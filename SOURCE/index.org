Konzentration

Gönnen Sie Ihrem Gehirn eine Pause
Das Gehirn erholt sich im Schlaf. Klar. Aber nicht nur. Auch im Wachzustand sind regelmässige Pausen wichtig.

Regelmässige Pausen sind keine verlorene Zeit.

Wer geistig über längere Zeit unter Strom steht, sollte immer wieder kleine oder auch längere Erholungsphasen einbauen. Das ist kein unnötiger Zeitverlust, im Gegenteil. Nichtstun ist eine wichtige Voraussetzung für Kreativität und Produktivität. Wer sein Potential nutzen will, muss ausruhen, die Gedanken schweifen lassen. Nur gönnen die Menschen sich viel zu wenige Pausen.

Kreativitätsforscher Ernst Pöppel, Chef des Münchner Instituts für Medizinische Psychologie (IMP), spricht gar von einem «Kreativitätsstau». Pöppel ist überzeugt, dass unsere Gesellschaft «geradezu explodieren könnte, wenn alle täglich eine Stunde aus dem Kommunikationszwang aussteigen würden».

Mach mal Pause!
Folgende Arten von Pausen haben sich für Studierende bewährt. In angepasster Form haben sie auch im Arbeitsprozess Gültigkeit:

Kurze Gedankenpausen/Verschnaufpausen: Damit können Sie Gelerntes abschliessen und die Verarbeitungsprozesse im Gehirn fangen an.
Minipausen: 5 Minuten alle 30 Minuten: kurz aufzustehen, einige Bewegungsübungen machen.
Kurzpausen: Spätestens nach 2 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie 15 bis 20 Minuten Pause machen. Tun Sie nichts ausser etwas trinken und vielleicht etwas (leichtes) essen.
Freizeitpausen: Nach 3 bis 4 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie sich 1 bis 2 Stunden lang erholen und diese freie Zeit bewusst geniessen.

Wundermittel Schlaf
Das wichtigste für ein leistungsfähiges Gehirn ist die regelmässige Nachtruhe. Das Gehirn nutzt und braucht den Schlaf, um zu verarbeiten, was es tagsüber geleistet hat. Mehr noch. Viele Probleme lösen sich geradezu über Nacht. Viele Menschen kommen beim Aufwachen oft auf Lösungen, die ihm am Vortag noch unlösbar schienen. Schlafforscher erklären das Phänomen so: Der Schlaf dient dazu, überflüssige Nervenverknüpfungen abzubauen und neue zu festigen. Im Schlaf überführt das Gehirn zudem neue Informationen vom Zwischenspeicher ins Langzeitgedächtnis verankert sie da.

Sport treiben und gesund essen
Das Gehirn kann sich aber auch aktiv erholen. Sport kann Ihnen helfen, Ihre Konzentration zu verbessern. Denn Sport kurbelt nicht nur den Stoffwechsel an, sondern verbessert auch die Sauerstoffzufuhr, was der Konzentrationsfähigkeit dient.

Wichtig für das Gehirn ist auch eine gesunde Ernährung. Am besten sind fünf kleinere Mahlzeiten regelmässig über den Tag verteilt. So bleibt Ihr Blutzuckerspiegel stabil. Denn ein tiefer Blutzuckerspielge führt zu Konzentrationsmangel und Leistungsabfall. Nebst genügend Kohlenhydraten, Eiweiss, Vitaminen und pflanzlichen ungesättigten Fetten braucht das Gehirn aber auch genügend Flüssigkeit wie Wasser, ungesüssten Tee oder verdünnte Fruchtsäfte. Lebensmittel, die besonders gut für Ihr Gehirn sind, finden Sie auf dem Merkblatt «Brainfood».

Nahrungsergänzungsmittel
Aufbau- und Vitaminpräparate sind eine sinnvolle Ergänzung zur ausgewogenen Ernährung. Vor allem, wenn beispielsweise nach einer Krankheit ein erhöhter Bedarf an Mineralien, Vitaminen und Spurenelementen besteht.

Vitamine: Vitamin C kann stimulieren. Die B-Vitamine unterstützen die Funktion des Nervensystems und setzen Energie aus Kohlenhydraten frei, die es für die korrekte Funktion der Hirnzellen braucht.
Pflanzliche Stoffe: Ginseng oder Ginkgo biloba können die Konzentration verbessern, indem sie die Durchblutung der Hirnzellen fördern. Bestimmte Lebensmittel respektive Gewürze wie Knoblauch, Zwiebeln, Kohl oder Cayennepfeffer fördern ebenfalls die Durchblutung.
Kaffee, Guarana und Cola wirken wegen ihres Koffeingehaltes stimulierend.

Marcel Duchamp by Man Ray (1920) & Etoile cosmique (1923) by Raymond Roussel

 « My soul is a strange factory » -Raymond Roussel

New Impressions of Raymond Roussel points us towards an intellectual history that maps out art’s role in creating a social allegory for the poetic psychoanalysis[1] of mechanized pleasure – in circular struggle with the mechanized mass killings of World War I and II, the holocaust, and Hiroshima. And the rewards of such exhausting circularity are considerable, given both the historical significance of Raymond Roussel’s influence and its unapologetic relevance to today’s cyber culture – with its intransigent obliqueness and mechanical dizziness.

But if I were going to generate an art exhibition as homage to a particularly flamboyant artist,[2] even if un peu obscur, I would think that it would be advantageous to try to match the aesthetic qualities of that person (absurdly intricate mechanical interlacings) with the show’s general aesthetic. Unfortunately, that was not the least bit achieved with the homage to the wildly creative dandy writer Raymond Roussel (1877-1933)[3] that is at the Palais de Tokyo centre d’art contemporain in Paris.

While access to much of the remarkable work here (including five of Roussel’s otherworldy hand written manuscript pages for his last book Comment j’ai écrit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books) and a wonderful cookie-encasing sculpture memento called Etoile cosmique (Cosmic Star) – a glass and silver case that Roussel had made for a star-shaped biscuit he brought back from lunch in Juvisy-sur-Orge with the astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842-1925) on July 29, 1923) is to be appreciated and relished, the cavernous half-finished Level 1 Galerie Seine devoured and neutralized any stylistic moods of gamesmanship that are associated with Roussel: such as the famously extravagant, yet intricately hermetic, elaborate mechanamorphic constructions that verged on the exuberantly preposterousness of a machine running infinitely wild. Perhaps if I had seen the other two manifestations of this show – Impressions of Raymond Roussel held at the Museo Reina Sofia (Madrid) in 2011 and the Museu Serralves (Porto) in 2012 – I may not have felt so disappointed in the general lack of neurotic deliriousness experienced in this one.

Granted that Raymond Roussel’s disregard for financial restraint[4] cannot be matched by the Palais de Tokyo, but still the gutted construction materials hanging overhead in this ugly cavernous space takes the eye and mind out of the magnificently intricate labyrinthine quality typical of his extravagant writings: as established in the prose work Impressions d’Afrique (1910) (a work that features a painting machine that duplicates the color spectrum of the sky at dawn),[5] Locus Solus (1914) (like Impressions d’Afrique, written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns) and the obsessive but convulsingly poetic Nouvelle Impressions d’Afrique (1932).[6] Thus the larger the art (even as it was needed to fill this mammoth half-raw space) the worse it connected to Roussel’s sense of virtual impenetrability through mechanical precision.

Mike Kelly’s lumbering black cave Kandors 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude) (2011) and Rodney Graham’s Camera Obscura Mobile (1995-1996) installation were particularly unmatched to Roussel’s obsessive minute attention; a concentration that is capable of whirling together copious narratives from a veiled network of murky puns and obscured double entendres in a way that anticipates Oulipian. Mark Manders’s steamy black connectivist sculpture Mind Study (2011), Giuseppe Gabellone’s beautiful silver sculpture L’Assetalo (Thirsty Man) (2008) and Jacques Carelman’s droll motion sculpture Le Diamont (The Dimond) (1975) worked only a bit better in reinforcing a spirit of intricate mechanicalness as they each ate up almost an entire room. A relatively fascinating installation by André Maranha, Pedro Morais, Jorge Queiroz and Francisco Tropa called Tres Moscas (Three Flies) (2012) did eat an entire room and only delivered limited thematic power in terms of absurd interlacing.

Much more capable of such finicky and arcane mesmerizing rhythms was the more intimate yet preposterous work of Thomas Bayrle (his deadpan pulsating romantic machine Spatz von Paris (2011) is one of the highlights of the show). Rodney Graham’s series of books called The System worked well in the context and it was captivating to see displays of the literary journal Revue Locus Solus, established by American writers John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, Kenneth Koch and James Shuyler. Published in Paris between 1961 and 1962, the journal formed a bridge between French authors, both historical and contemporary, and writers from the New York School and the Beat Generation. The Collège de Pataphysique was represented by the writer Jean Ferry who published several studies devoted to Roussel, including L’Afrique des Impressions, a detailed analysis which consists of considering the text as instructions for users and reconstructing, in the form of maps, diagrams and schedules, the journeys and events that took place at Ponukélé, an imaginary place in Roussel’s Africa. Two comical cosmic Joseph Cornell boxes, Blue Sand Box and Sand Fountain from the early 1950s pleased me, as they bracketed a stream of photographed drawings of fantastic imaginary architecture from 1857 by Victorien Sardou – as did an early Pataphysical video by Jean-Christophe Averty. The irascible Salvador Dalí is represented with his short motion picture Impressions de la Haute Mongolie (1975), made with the filmmaker José Montes-Baquer. Dalí read Roussel’s books as early as the 1920s and Roussel had a great influence on Dalí’s “critical paranoia” method. Dalí, who died with a copy of Impressions d’Afrique on his bedside table, believed him to be one of France’s greatest writers ever. Jean Tinguely is inserted, rightly, into this mix with a brain-teasing manic lithograph from 1966-67 called Requiem pour une feuille morte (Requiem for a Dead Leaf), rather than an expected endless drawing machine contraption, that would have more directly interlocked with Roussel’s imagined painting machine.

And Roussel’s major inspiration (along with novelist and naval officer Pierre Loti), the author Jules Verne, has a wacky lithograph of a flat globe studded with images entitled Around the World in Eighty Days from 1880. Roussel greatly admired the works of Verne – which he read over and over again, fascinated with their extraodinary voyages and machines, full of bachelor scientists completely absorbed in positivist exploratory dreams taken to delirious extremes. At that scale of interlacing, some of the hypnotic effect of Roussel’s capacious playful circularity is possible to feel.

However, Gabriele Di Matteo’s contribution to the show’s circularity is essential. His hand-painted over digital-painting Marcel Duchamp, a life in pictures by André Raffray illustrates the time when Duchamp attended a showing of Impressions d’Afrique in 1912, an experience Duchamp would describe as revelatory. As Gabriele Di Matteo depicts, Duchamp, along with Guillaume Appollinaire, Picabia and Picabia’s wife Gabrielle Buffet, attended a performance of Impressions of Africa: the play by Roussel based on his book. Duchamp later credited Roussel with the inspiration for his The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass). There are several original notes by Duchamp and a drawing that he made for The Large Glass in 1912-1915 in the show, as well as quite a few photos of Duchamp with The Large Glass. Among them is the striking photo of Duchamp that was taken by Man Ray in 1920 that shows a star carved out in Duchamp’s hair. This work connects ludicrously well with Roussel’s star shaped cookie piece, Etoile cosmique, from just three years later.

Historically, the mechanamorphic impulse behind Marcel Duchamp’s works from 1912 (that derived a good deal from Roussel) is of great significance. That is when Duchamp started producing paintings and drawings depicting mechanized sex acts such as Mechanics of Modesty and The Passage from the Virgin to the Bride – and the fantastic machine-body work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even that follow his exposure to the play Impressions d’Afrique – is an inescapable point of reference for the avant-garde of the 20th century. The same may be said for Francis Picabia (who has a room of paintings all to himself at the show La Collection Michael Werner just a stone throw away at the Musée d’Art Moderne Ville de Paris).

The elaborateness of the machine, for Duchamp and Picabia, became the symbol of sexual bliss[7] attainable through concept connected to auto-sexual autonomy in contradiction to the horror that mechanized war had brought. By hypnotizing attention, the machine freed them from troubling obsessions and personal hang-ups through the alternative model of android life; intimating both our rush of desperation and our ecstatic release, refracted through a web of glazed impersonality. If the machine, as a representative of order, was a fascination Duchamp and Picabia used to balance out the age’s clumsiness, whether of the mind or flesh, Roussel’s mechanamorphic production and machine forms refigured the human body into an almost mechanized substance.

In The Bride Stripped Bare by the Bachelors, Even, which positions a central bride machine over a bachelor apparatus, Duchamp, with the strictness of machinery, applies fantasy to seduction and masturbation. In a way, Duchamp suggests that we (as viewers) can use his art as a vehicle for self-transcendence into a kind of dream world of nonsense sex. This rabbit-hole logic he took from Roussel.

So New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it outlines an eccentric expanding circular history of 20th-century art, linking the points between artists and writers who have talked of the influence of this author and his writings on their work: starting with Dada (Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia), then André Breton and the Surrealists (like Michel Leiris, Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau) to Neo-Dada Nouveau réalisme (Jean Tinguely) through Oulipo (Georges Perec) Pataphysicians (Jean Ferry, Jean-Christophe Averty and the Collège de Pataphysique) and the authors of the nouveau roman (like Alain Robbe-Grillet). As noted above, his most direct influence in the English-speaking world was on the New York School of poets John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler, and Kenneth Koch.

Writing as art – or – art as writing: this is the theoretical ripe fruit plucked from Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel – art theory as art – made conceivable by Roussel’s inventions of language machines that produced texts through the use of repetitions and combination/permutations. This machine-like logic provides art with a seemingly pure spectacle of endless variety of textual games and combinations flowing in circular form. (We see and feel this most fully, however, in the sprawling and dazzling Julio Le Parc kinetic op art retrospective on the first floor of the Palais de Tokyo, rather than in this show.)

And there are lessons here for painting, also. Within this writing process Roussel described a number of fantastic machines, including a painting machine in his novel Impressions of Africa. This painting machine wonderfully describes and foresees the arrival of computer-robotic technology and it’s application to visual art which we have available to us today, a century after he envisioned it.

The web also regenerates deep connections to the past; so cyberspace, this territory which stretches out from hypertext to the world-wide computer network, from virtual reality to video games, might also be theorized as the domain of Roussel’s idea of reduplicating without duplication, reiterating without repeating: his game-of-mirrors cosmos. His is a strident activity lost in an infinite navigation from one sort of encounter to another in which the affirmation of the other keeps appearing and disappearing in the play of mechanical maneuvers (or mechanisms) destined to avert gratification. This is where the bachelor apparatus of Duchamp repeats itself ad infinitum by transmitting the machine via an alter-ego.

But too, New Impressions of Raymond Roussel reminds us that Raymond Roussel’s themes and procedures also involved imprisonment and liberation, exoticism, cryptograms and torture by language – all formally reflected in his working technique with its inextricable play of double images, repetitions, and impediments, all giving the impression of the pen running on by itself through the dreamy usage and baroque play of mirrored form.

Roussel’s running on repetition technique, as used in the Thomas Bayrle sculpture, for example, lends itself well to the creation of unforeseen, automatic and spontaneously art which gives me the feeling of prolonging action into eternity through the ceaseless, fantastic constructions of the work itself, transmitting an altered, exalted and orgasmic state of mind which after the initial dazzling creates one predominant overall effect: that of creating doubt through mechanical discourse.

The image of enclosure is common with Roussel where a secret to a secret is held back, systematically imposing a formless anxiety in the reader through the labyrinthine extensions and doublings, disguises and duplications of his texts, which make all speech and vision undergo a moment of annihilation.

New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it presents to us through intimacy the model of quiet perfection of the eternally repetitive mechanical machine which functions independently of time and space, pulling us into a logic of the infinite. We can learn this from Roussel’s final rebus-like book, Comment j’ai écrit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books); the last of his conceptual machines, the machine which contains and repeats within its mechanism all those mental machines he had formerly described and put into motion, making evident the machine which produced all of his machines – the master machine.[8] All of these machines map out an eccentric spiral space that is circular in nature and thus an abstract attempt at eliminating time. They reproduce the old myths of departure, of loss and of return. They construct a crisscrossed mechanical map of the two great mythic spaces so often explored by western imagination: space that is rigid and forbidden, containing the quest, the return and the treasure (for example the geography of the Argonauts and the labyrinth) – and the other space of polymorphosis noise: the visible transformation of instantly crossed frontiers and borders, of strange affiliations, of spells, and of symbolic replacements (the space of the Minotaur).

Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel potentially removes us out of our quiet and glib indolence and points us in the potent direction of expanding intensity. I believe that shows like Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel are critical to us now because the counter-mannerist excess found there may problematize the popular simulacra that art has become – and make the underground intricately-strange privateness of the human animal more lively.

Notes:
[1] At age 17, Roussel wrote Mon Âme, a long poem published three years later in Le Gaulois. By 1896, he had commenced editing his long poem La Doublure when he suffered a mental crisis. After the poem was published on June 10, 1897 and was completely unsuccessful, Roussel began to see the psychiatrist Pierre Janet.

[2] Poet, novelist, playwright, musician, and chess enthusiast

[3] Raymond Roussel was born in Paris in 1877. His writings, including the novels Impressions of Africa and Locus Solus and volumes of poetry and drama, were largely ignored in his lifetime, but have since been championed by the likes of Michel Leiris (whose father was Roussel’s accountant), Raymond Queneau, Alain Robbe-Grillet (his first novel, Le Voyeur, was originally titled La Vue in homage to Roussel’s long 1904 poem of the same name), Georges Perec, Harry Mathews, John Ashbery and Michel Foucault (Foucault wrote a critical study, Death and the Labyrinth, after the chance discovery of one of Roussel’s volumes in an antiquarian shop across from the Luxembourg Gardens). Roussel died under mysterious circumstances (apparently by suicide) in 1933 in Palermo, Sicily after he went broke chasing literary fame before his death – decades before his work began receiving the acceptance he craved. He is buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

[4] In 1894, at age 16, he inherited a substantial fortune from his deceased father and began to write poetry to accompany his musical compositions. Tremendously wealthy, he took two world tours during which he hardly left his hotel rooms.

[5] The story told in Impressions of Africa is a nominally bare-bones fantasy. The shipwrecked inhabitants of the Lyseus, en route from Marseille to Argentina, are captured by an African potentate, Talou, who holds them hostage while awaiting their ransom. The ship’s manifest includes actors, singers, musicians, fearless naturalists, a slew of carpenters, and, fortuitously, a trove of instruments, lumber, scientific equipment, and trained animals. Partly to keep themselves busy, the motley Europeans, dubbing themselves the Incomparables, decide to stage a set of performances. Converging with their gala is Talou’s military triumph over a rival clan (and the execution of a handful of unloyal subjects). This is the back-story of Impressions of Africa, literally.

[6]  New Impressions of Africa is a 1,274-line poem, consisting of four long cantos in rhymed alexandrines, each a single sentence with parenthetical asides that run up to five levels deep. From time to time, a footnote refers to a further poem containing its own depths of brackets. Roussel worked and reworked the 1,274 lines of New Impressions of Africa over a seventeen-year period, rewriting each one as many as twenty times to accomplish a mordant succinctness.

[7] Around the same point in time, Dr. Freud was explaining in his lectures that complex machines that repeat in dreams signified the genital organs. Roussel’s descriptions of eggs on plates and the multiple allusions to the odor of urine after the eating of asparagus are typical of a poetic-mechanical apparatus helping to take us further into the area of the unconscious and the sexual.

[8] Roussel had kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, How I Wrote Certain of My Books, where he describes it as follows: “I chose two similar words. For example, billard (billiard) and pillard (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two sentences found, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.”

One Response to Review of Nouvelles Impressions de Raymond Roussel
G. W. Smith says:
April 14, 2013 at 11:12 pm
The appearance of Joseph Nechvatal’s byline in On-Verge, is, in one sense, paradoxical, for Dr. Nechvatal is by no means an emerging writer; indeed, he has had perhaps more of value to say, in scores of books and articles, than any other art theorist regarding the the survival of the thinking, breathing — and loving — individual within our modern technological matrix. This is amply demonstrated in the current review, of a show dedicated to one of those wonderful French intellectuals, Raymond Roussel, whose writings not only helped his fellow Europeans survive the mechanized horrors of the early twentieth century, but which also — through a type of verbal jujitsu — allowed them to retain their own hold on the indispensable machine — this to the great benefit of his followers including Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Jean Tinguely.

If, however, we take “On-Verge” to refer also to the dawn of a new post-postModernist age — in which the vitality and precision of technology is married to a humanistic sensibility — then the appearance of Dr. Nechvatal’s review is both appropriate — and welcomed.

After displaying your calfw buffer, you can get a HTML buffer with M-x htmlfontify-buffer.

Hi Eric,
thanks for the tip. I tried this already. Its printing but has some drawbacks. E.g. I use high resolution monitors in vertical (pivot) mode and a tiling window manager. calfw scales to the current buffer size and this is unfortunately not really compatible with printing. In summary this solution might have to many ways to go wrong.

However, I noticed a much more interesting way. calfw buffer look almost like org-tables. And voila saving the buffer as org-file and a minimum of modifications allows me to export the calendar with both the html and pdf exporter. I just try to tell org-mode/latex/html to keep the height of the rows constant and independent of the content of the cell. Guess if I get this right, everything could be done in a little piece of elisp.
Alternatively, Sakurai san may like to create an official cfw:export-view-to-org could be part of calfw-org. This would also allow people to archive calendar views in org-mode files.

Much of my pure syntactic research over the past few years is consolidated in Provocative Syntax. I'm continuing on with my investigations in this model of morphosyntax. Doug Wharram and I have begun to study how syntactic "provocation" and semantics interact in the interpretation of Inuktitut indefinites.

I've also published work on the nature of ergativity (with Jonathan Bobaljik) and on quotative inversion (with Chris Collins).

***** Pretend like you’re a human being
With the possible exception of artists and architects, no one is more full of shit than designers. We can find a way to justify anything. Blah blah blah. That means no matter what you end up with, you can come up with some reason why it’s a good design. The best advice I have for designers is to practice being not-designers: stop what you’re doing, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths and then look again like you’re just a regular person encountering this product/service/user interface/object/page/poster for the first time. Where do your eyes go? What do you think it is at first? How do you figure out what you are supposed to do?
***** Make it inevitable
There is some truth to that old Henry Ford aphorism “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t — you’re right.”. If you can’t believe it, it’s probably not going to happen. However, I like to take that one step further and ensure that every action we take is one that assumes the desired outcome is inevitable. Do not make actions that are out of alignment with that inevitability. Do not allow judgements which contradict it. The more evidence you have — and everyone else has — that things will come out as planned, the more likely it will be so.
***** Every job you do has your signature on it
When I was around 10 or 11 years old, my father offered me $10 to move a cord of recently-delivered firewood from the driveway into the garage and stack it up inside (I am old; $10 was a great deal of money back then). I managed to get all the firewood inside but rather than it being stacked against the wall, it was more or less evenly distributed across the floor of the garage. I expected my payment, but instead got some advice: “Every job you do has your signature on it — do you really want to sign that?” I always remembered that and if I am going to do something, I make every effort to do it right. (I also properly stacked the wood afterwards, even though it took forever, and I got paid in the end.)
***** Everyone should always be trying to make it easier for everyone
I used to play in a band. Other people might have played team sports, or worked in a well-functioning restaurant. There’s something about working deeply, in real-time, with other people that’s both incredibly satisfying and enormously more effective than working alone. You need to be open for the pass, you need to hear the subtle rhythm shifts, you need to spot when someone else’s table needs the check … everyone should be taking account of what everyone else is doing and constantly modifying their own behaviour to better serve the team.
***** Know why you’re doing it
If you are just out to make money, god bless: I hope you make some money. If you just want awards or recognition or for others to think highly of you, I hope you get that too. But I don’t think anyone is really satisfied by fame or fortune. I find it incredibly satisfying (and gratifying, rewarding and pleasant) to honestly have done the best job I could have done on something and I believe that works for everyone else too. Being skillful and exercising your mastery is what you’re here to do. Doing anything less undermines the whole point of being alive.

EMPAC Research: A New Paradigm for Interactive Exploration of Data with Live Coding
from EMPAC @ Rensselaer PLUS  1 year ago / Creative Commons License: by sa  ALL AUDIENCES

Part 1: Exploring a Dark Data Set ( 13 min. )

Part 2: The Field Environment ( 10 min. )

Interactive data exploration - as opposed to documentation of research outcomes - requires a hard- and software environment that allows quick turn-around (as in live coding), accelerated graphics processing and projection (utilizing GPUs for data processing), an “agnostic” parsing of data, and the ability to tap into the endless existing libraries available on-line. This approach allows quick access to and navigation of “big data”.

The open-source software Field programming environment provides all of the above. It allows to quickly manipulate different representations of a given data set, to navigate representation interactively, to create animations and to discover new perspectives.

Mathematical processes applied to the data can be changed as quickly as the mapping in the visual domain. Other modalities of representation, like stereoscopic visual representation, immersive projections or auditory mapping can easily be accessed.

This video shows in its first part the exploration of a “dark data set”, where the source and desired evaluation of the data was not known to the researcher visualizing the data. It turned out to be the simulation output of a high-performance computing network topology (“Dragon Fly Network”). Immediately insights into the data were unfolding and allowed to discover properties in the simulation, which had gone unnoticed before.

The second part presents an overview over the Field environment.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Celebrating Einstein strives to communicate all of this beauty and excitement to the general public by bridging the gap between the sciences and the arts in both its design and end products. This event is a truly collaborative and interdisciplinary effort between the departments of physics, history, communication, music, film, photography, art, and architecture at Montana State University, Princeton University, and UCLA. These many different fields all use creativity to invent new ideas that deepen our understanding of the world. Einstein's iconic figure, the centennial of the discovery of his most important theory, and the imminent direct detection of his final prediction produce a perfect theme for Celebrating Einstein.

Celebrating Einstein includes several events: a public lecture series by world-renowned scientists, including University of Maryland's Jim Gates, recipient of the National Medal of Science and member of the President's Science Advisory Panel, and David Kaiser, a best-selling author and the head of the MIT Program in Science, Technology and Society; Celebrating Einstein in the Schools, a collection of K-12 classroom lessons and activities; the Black (W)hole art installation, featuring visualizations and sounds of a small black hole spiraling violently into a supermassive one; and the Shout Across Time live multimedia theatre show, which will feature a dance-company performance illustrating a lecture on general relativity, a live orchestra, playing an original composition inspired by gravitational waves, and an original film featuring numerical simulations of black hole collisions.

***** Architecture
****** Arena Do Morro, Natal, Brazil – Herzog & de Meuron

This gymnasium was created from an existing sports facility situated in Mãe Luiza, a favela in Natal, north-east Brazil. It now contains a sports field with tiered seating for 420 people, multipurpose rooms for dance and education, a terrace with ocean views, as well as changing rooms and public restrooms. The building's standout feature is its generous roof, which is constructed to allow light and air in but keep water out, giving a new civic place visible from afar. The two ends of the elongated pitched roof open up towards the neighbourhood and invite people in.
****** Beijing No 4 High School Fangshan Campus, Beijing, China – OPEN Architecture

Also called the Garden School, this building is part of a larger scheme to build a healthier and self-sustainable new town just outside Beijing. The desire to create more open spaces filled with nature, combined with the space limitations of the site, inspired a strategy on the vertical dimension, creating multiple grounds by separating the programs into above and below, and inserting gardens in-between. The roof-top of the upper building is designed to be an organic farm, with 36 plots - one for each class in the school, providing students the chance to learn the techniques of farming, and also paying tribute to the site's pastoral past.
****** Desert Courtyard House by Wendell Burnette Architects

Desert Courtyard House, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA – Wendell Burnette Architects

A private house in Arizona's Sonoran Desert which has been designed around a courtyard. The ancient construction method of rammed earth was used to create walls offering high thermal mass and a direct relationship to the surrounding landscape. By paying close attention to the desert location the architects have created a house which spirals up from lowest point at southwest corner and out towards a sunset view.
****** Forfatterhuset Kindergarten Copenhagen by COBE

Forfatterhuset Kindergarten, Copenhagen, Denmark – COBE

With its curved corners, lush roof gardens and special brick facade, the new kindergarten in Copenhagen creates a warm modern feeling while respecting its historic surroundings. The project consists of five small houses held together by a brick band which also surrounds the playground. The Kindergarten is organized like a village, creating a place that is functional and flexible for adults, while also small and exciting for children.
****** Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, France – Frank Gehry and Gehry Partners

The Fondation Louis Vuitton houses temporary displays, the permanent art collection and concerts in a 'glass cloud' of 12 curved sails that emerge from the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. The building's distinctive shape has been made using over three thousand curved and fritted glass panels.
****** House for Trees by Vo Trong Nghia Architects

House for Trees, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam – Vo Trong Nghia Architects

Under rapid urbanization, cities in Vietnam have diverged far from their origins as sprawling tropical forests. An over-abundance of motorbikes causes daily traffic congestion as well as serious air pollution. House for Trees is an effort to change this situation. The aim is to bring green back into the city, accommodating high-density dwelling with big tropical trees. Five concrete boxes are designed as 'pots' to plant trees on their tops. With thick soil layer, these pots also function as storm-water basins for retention, therefore contribute to reduce the risk of flooding when the idea is multiplied to a large number of houses in the future.
****** La Última Esperanza – The Last Hope, Manabi, Ecuador – AL BORDE

La Última Esperanza is the final iteration of a long-term collaboration between AL BORDE and the Cabuyal community which has already produced a school and a community centre. This project saw the architects design not a building, but system for teaching architecture so that the community can become more self-sufficient, developing their own methodology of design, and ultimately creating their own buildings.
****** Long Museum West Bund, Shanghai, China – Atelier Deshaus

Long Museum West Bund is located at the bank of Huangpu River, Xuhui District, Shanghai Municipality, on a site which had been used as the wharf for coal transportation. The design of the new museum adopts a cantilever structure featuring an umbrella vault which visually echoes a remaining coal hopper unloading bridge - a symbol of the area's industrial past.
****** Markthal Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands – MVRDV

Located in the center of Rotterdam, Markthal is the first covered food market of the Netherlands. Each of the 228 apartments has a view either towards the historic Laurenskwartier, and towards the market through windows or a glass floor made of sound and smell proof triple glazing. The open sides of the Markthal closed to prevent rain and cold from entering, was designed to be as transparent as possible by opting for a single glazed cable net façade. The mural 'Cornucopia' by artists Arno Coenen and Iris Roskam has a surface of 11.000 m2. 'Cornucopia' shows oversized images of market produce available at the market, while the flowers and insects refer to the work of Dutch still life masters from the 17th century. The image was printed onto perforated aluminum panels, and then attached to acoustic panels for noise control.
****** Central Park by Jean Nouvel

One Central Park, Sydney, Australia – Ateliers Jean Nouvel

Two landmark towers designed by Jean Nouvel for the second phase of the One Central Park project have transformed Sydney's skyline. The program comprises an exclusively residential apartment block of 34 stories and a 12-story apartment block that sits on a common retail and recreational podium. A vertical landscaped garden designed in collaboration with French artist and botanist Patrick Blanc covers approximately 50% of the buildings' façade.
****** Szczecin Philharmonic by Barozzi Veiga

Philharmonic Hall Szczecin, Szczecin, Poland – Barozzi / Veiga

The new Philharmonic Hall of Szczecin is located on the historical site of the 'Konzerthaus', which was destroyed during Second World War and recomposes an urban corner in a neighbourhood near to the historic city. The building houses a symphony hall for 1000 spectators, a hall for chamber music, a multifunctional space for exhibitions and conferences, and a wide foyer, which can also be used to host events. The hall is composed following a Fibonacci sequence whose fragmentation increases with the distance from the scene, and gives shape to an ornamental space whose gold-leaf covering calls to mind the classical tradition.
****** Sancaklar Mosque, Istanbul, Turkey – Emre Arolat Architects

Inspired by the fact that a mosque does not have a predefined form and anywhere clean may be a prayer room, this project focused on the 'essence' of a religious space, distancing itself from discussions based on form. The design aimed at representing purest forms of light and matter, just as a primary inner world, free from all cultural burdens. The disappearance of the building in to the slope of the site, anchored to the ground, creates the sense that it has always been a part of this landscape.
****** Saw Swee Hock Student Centre, London School of Economics, London, UK – O'Donnell + Tuomey

The site specific sculptural concept for this design is tailored in response to specific lines of sight along approaching vistas, from street corner perspectives and to make visual connections between internal and external circulation. The surface of the brick skin is cut out along fold lines to form large areas of glazing, framing views from street to room. The design is assembled to make one coherent volume from a complex set of component parts. The building is clad with bricks, used in a new way, with each brick offset from the next in an open work pattern, wrapping the walls in a permeable blanket, creating dappled daylight inside and glowing like a lattice lantern at night.
****** UC-Innovation-Center-by-Elemental_dezeen_sqa

UC Innovation Center – Anacleto Angelini, Santiago, Chile – Elemental

Santiago's weather inspired the architects to substitute the contemporary typical glass skin, responsible for serious greenhouse effect in interiors, for a thermal mass on the perimeter that avoids undesired heat gains. Open air squares are multiplied throughout the building's entire height and a permeable atrium core is proposed so that while circulating vertically, people could see what others are doing. As well as creating the right environment for knowledge-creation, this design has reduced energy costs by two-thirds.
****** Waterbank Campus at Endana Secondary School, Laikipia, Kenya – PITCHAfrica

A 'model' rain harvesting school campus for semi-arid regions, the aim of this project is to support education with specially designed buildings that integrate water collection, storage and filtration with agriculture, using football as a catalyst, providing a gathering place and vehicle for environmental education and the resolution of ethnic tensions across the region. The 'Waterbank Campus' occupies a 10 acre site integrating 4 acres of irrigated conservation agriculture with 7 unique, low-cost, rain harvesting building types developed by PITCHAfrica, and termed 'Waterbanks' because of each building's capacity to harvest and store high volumes of water using extremely low cost construction and locally available skills and materials, providing a year round supply for poverty stricken regions.
***** Digital
****** Disclosed – Marion Ferrec at the Royal College of Art, in collaboration with Kate Wakely

Disclosed is a service concept which offers a transparency certification and data ecosystem – the aim being to help shoppers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Through simple and tailored digital layers of information, users can act on what they individually believe matters for their health and the planet. Disclosed helps users gain more control over their consumption and channel their spending into products that best meet their ambitions, ultimately influencing retailers to invest in lines that better reflect those.
****** MegaFaces installation by Asif Khan_dezeen_1sq

Megafaces – Asif Khan

Megafaces, which debuted at the Sochi Olympics, is an experimental architectural installation. It comprises a large scale kinetic-volumetric LED display supported by a bank of automated 3D-scanning photo booths, an automated 3D scan meshing system, a tablet app which uses QR-code cards, an SMS notification system, an automated 3D modelling and lighting algorithm, a web portal, and a video streaming service. The installation was commissioned by MegaFon. Described by the designer as 'A Mount Rushmore for the digital age', Megafaces is a building which could physically transform to take on the appearance of the people visiting it.
****** Monument Valley – ustwogames

Inspired by the art of M.C. Escher, Japanese prints and minimalist 3D design, Monument Valley is a surreal exploration through fantastical architecture and impossible geometry. Players of this mobile game must guide the silent Princess Ida through mysterious monuments, uncovering hidden paths, taking advantage of optical illusions and outsmarting the enigmatic Crow People. Each level is a hand-crafted combination of puzzle, graphic design and architecture.
****** No Man's Sky – Sean Murray

No Man's Sky is a science-fiction-based videogame about exploration and survival in an infinite procedurally generated galaxy. The aim is to ensure that players experience the sense of wonder captured by classic science-fiction stories - and to ensure that there are things in the galaxy of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 planets that not even the developers are aware of. This scope is made possible by a unique engine, developed in-house. Using procedural generation, the engine uses the computational power of next-generation consoles and PCs to generate terrain as the player explores.
****** Digital_Calliper_by_Unfold_dezeen_sq0

Of Instruments and Archetypes – Claire Warnier + Dries Verbruggen, Unfold (concept, design & hardware), Penny Webb (design & prototyping), Jesse Kirschner (concept & software)

Of Instruments and Archetypes is a range of wireless digital measuring instruments that transfer in realtime, measurements of physical objects to an on-screen digital 3D model. These instruments are designed to be used in applications where archetypical, parametric objects can be customised with exact measurements and materialised by digital production techniques such as 3D printing.
****** Responsive Street Furniture – Ross Atkin (Conceptual design and digital system development), Jonathan Scott (Physical design and engineering)

Responsive Street Furniture uses smart technology to make streets easier to use for disabled people with different kinds of impairments, including reduced mobility, low vision, blindness and learning difficulties. The system consists of a website where users can register their smartphone, or a low-cost key fob, then request helpful services such as additional places to sit, brighter street lighting, longer crossing times or audio information, which are activated when users approach a responsive item. The system could also be used for tourists and foreign visitors - providing audio information in native and foreign languages.
****** Shadowing – Jonathan Chomko, Matthew Rosier

Shadowing is an interactive installation embedded within streetlights throughout Bristol. It creates pockets of memory in the street; capturing the shadow of a pedestrian as they pass underneath the streetlight and then projecting it back to accompany the next person who passes by.

****** Ocean-Clean-Up-Dezeen

The Ocean Cleanup – Boyan Slat (CEO and founder), Jan de Sonneville PhD (Lead engineer), Erwin Zwart (Designer)

Calling itself 'the largest clean up in history', this project aims to develop environmentally friendly, large-scale, and efficient removal of plastic pollution from aquatic ecosystems. Founded by Dutch environmentalist Boyan Slat after he encountered more plastic bags than fish while diving in Greece at the age of 16, the proposal takes the form of a network of floating barriers which cause natural currents to push plastics towards a central platform, allowing for efficient extraction and storage of concentrated plastic for transportation to land. The Ocean Cleanup recently raised over US$2 million through a crowd funding campaign, which the organisation plans to use for the construction and testing of large-scale operational pilots.
****** The Refugee Project – Hyperakt and Ekene Ijeoma

****** design-for-extinction_dezeen

Designing for the Sixth Extinction – Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg

Commissioned by Science Gallery, Dublin, Designing for the Sixth Extinction investigates synthetic biology's potential impact on biodiversity and conservation. The project imagines a future in which new companion species designed by synthetic biologists support endangered natural species and ecosystems. Modeled on fungus, bacteria, invertebrates and mammals, the designed species are ecological machines that fill the void left by vanished organisms, or offer novel protection against more harmful invasive species, diseases and pollution. But are they even 'alive'? If nature is totally industrialized for the benefit of society—which for some is the logical endpoint of synthetic biology — will nature still exist for us to save?

****** Blue Diversion – Eawag (The Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology) and EOOS

2.5 billion people around the globe have no access to safe sanitation, causing severe diarrhoea, which kills 1.8 million people each year, primarily children under the age of 5. Furthermore, urine and faeces are severely polluting the environment. Blue Diversion is a grid-free dry diversion toilet, ie with no connection to piped water, sewers or electricity. Urine, faeces and flush-and-wash water are collected separately below the pan. The used water is recovered directly in the toilet by means of an innovative, energy-efficient and maintenance-free membrane bioreactor followed by on-site production of chlorine through electrolysis. This multi-barrier water treatment system included in the back wall of the toilet provides about 7 litres of hygienically safe water per user and day with little energy (provided by a small solar panel on the roof) and only minimal water losses. The Blue Diversion Toilet features a business model, which includes a collection system for urine and faeces, along with semi-centralised recycling plants for the production of valuable fertiliser and biogas.

****** Human Organs-on-Chips – Donald Ingber and Dan Dongeun

Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have adapted computer microchip manufacturing methods to design and fabricate crystal-clear microdevices lined with living human cells that mimic the complex tissue structures, functions and mechanical motions of whole organs; they are essentially living 'Human Organs-on-Chips'. Each Organ-on-a-Chip models natural tissue structures and mirrors the dynamic mechanical behavior of internal organs. Chips can also can be linked to form a 'Human Body-on-Chips', which can be analyzed to learn how drugs impact each organ as they are distributed and metabolized throughout the body. Cells from individual patients or from genetically-related populations can be used to inhabit these Organs-on-Chips to build mimics of their organs, a tactic that promises to advance personalized medicine, accelerate drug discovery and decrease development costs.

****** Project Daniel: 3D printing limbs – Mick Ebeling / Not Impossible

Project Daniel is the world's first 3D-printing prosthetic lab, set up by Not Impossible founder Mick Ebeling after he saw footage of a teenager who lost both arms when a bomb went off while he was tending his parents' cattle. The young man was Daniel Omar, a resident of a sprawling refugee camp called Yida. Ebeling tracked him down via humanitarian physician Dr. Tom Catena, and set about creating new limbs for Daniel with the help of a team of makers and Richard van As, the founder of open-source 3D-printing prosthetic company Robohand. The project has a legacy beyond Daniel's new limbs — Not Impossible left two 3D printers in Dr. Catena's Nuba Mountains hospital, in a community that had no concept of 3D-printing before his arrival. Ebeling trained locals to use the equipment so that other victims of the conflict are able to get access to a limb that costs $100 of materials, a fraction of the price of traditional solutions.

Here is what he writes about notmuch vs mu4e:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
notmuch vs mu4e

Since I decided early on to go with an Emacs-based e-mail client, learning a new e-mail client got a lot easier. I know Emacs Lisp pretty darn well. In the worst case of getting stuck, I could very easily study the client's source code and work out for myself whatever is going on. I could even monkey patch it in my configuration if it was causing problems for me (and I've already done exactly that).

I wanted to use the Maildir format, something I could hack on if needed. The two obvious choices for this were mu4e and notmuch, both started in 2009. I initially reached for mu4e. Compared to notmuch, it follows Emacs idioms more closely. For example, the e-mail listing is oriented around a mark and execute paradigm, like a dired buffer. After an initial glance, it felt more integrated.

Unfortunately, mu4e is still not mature enough for real productive use, making it far too risky for e-mail. I found out the hard way that the database format has varied regularly between versions. Worse, mu4e is not suitable for remote access. Not only does it assume the Maildir directory is on the local host, it uses absolute paths to access it, so it won't work over sshfs as I had hoped. Bummer.

In contrast, the notmuch client is specifically designed to be operated remotely. Emacs doesn't realize that it runs the notmuch client over SSH. Emacs doesn't need to touch the Maildir directly. It's a beautiful setup, one very friendly to versioning dotfiles. I've already done some pretty heavy configuration to get it exactly the way I want it. On top of this, notmuch is incredibly fast and stable. It's been a very enjoyable client. So much so that it inspired me to build a web feed reader with a similar interface (to be described in my next post).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For more information, see: worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum
Throughout the history of science, diagrams and graphs have been essential thinking tools. In the past, such visualizations were drawn with pen on paper, and could embrace the directness, freedom, and expressiveness of hand drawing. Most modern visualizations are programmed instead, where a single description can dynamically generate a unique picture for any dataset.

Today's tools offer the benefits of one or the other -- either directness or dynamics -- but not both. Photoshop and Illustrator allow direct-manipulation drawing of static pictures. D3, R, and Processing allow indirect-manipulation coding of dynamic pictures.
This talk presents a tool for drawing dynamic pictures -- creating data-driven visualizations, like D3, but via direct manipulation of the picture itself, like Illustrator.

Recorded at the Stanford HCI seminar on February 1, 2013.

Quote:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Here's a trick question: /How do we get people to understand programming?/

Khan Academy recently launched an online environment for learning to program. It offers a set of tutorials based on the JavaScript and Processing languages, and features a "live coding" environment, where the program's output updates as the programmer types.

Because my work was cited as an inspiration for the Khan system, I felt I should respond with two thoughts about learning:

- Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill. Learning about "for" loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw.
- People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.

Thus, the goals of a programming system should be:

- to support and encourage powerful ways of thinking
- to enable programmers to see and understand the execution of their programs

A live-coding Processing environment addresses neither of these goals. JavaScript and Processing are poorly-designed languages that support weak ways of thinking, and ignore decades of learning about learning. And live coding, as a standalone feature, is worthless.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This question will seem preposterous to most. Viruses
are molecular genetic parasites and are mostly recognized for
their ability to induce disease in their host. Their effect on host
evolution has long been thought to be like that of a predator on its
prey, eliminating the host with weakened defenses. How can we propose
any constructive role for viruses? Many viruses, however, can
infect their host in a stable and persisting manner, generally with no
disease, often for the life of the host. Such viruses can bring to bear
onto their host the viral seeds of genetic creation. (Villareal: 1).

Winner 2014: http://www.copernicus-masters.com/index.php?kat=winners.html&anzeige=winner_airbus_hisdesat2014.html

Since 2011, the annual Copernicus Masters competition is awarding prizes to innovative solutions for business and society based on Earth observation data.

With the launch of Sentinel-1A in April 2014, a new era is set to begin for applications in the entire geospatial value chain. It is the first of the new fleet of ESA Earth observation satellites, which are poised to deliver the wealth of data and imagery that are at the core of Europe's flagship programme Copernicus. The Earth monitoring competition Copernicus Masters aims to support the development of market-oriented applications based on Earth observation data. In 2014, for the first time, the Copernicus Masters was carried out worldwide.
The 171 submissions received from 43 countries in 2014 offer an excellent glimpse of the next generation of Earth observation services, which are set to benefit in particular from the expansion of digital infrastructures. The satellites now in orbit and the network development taking place here on Earth, for example, are expected to further accelerate the provision of current Earth observation data.
It included exciting topic specific Challenges that were awarded by an array of prominent partners, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), T-Systems International GmbH, European Space Imaging GmbH & Skybox Imaging Inc., CloudEO AG, Airbus Defence and Space & Hisdesat S.A., and Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd.

The submission phase war running from 15 April to 20 July. Participants were competing for their share of this year's EUR 300,000 prize pool.

In addition to cash prizes, this prize pool primarily includes support for the commercial realisation of the winning ideas, data access, and the chance to enter the incubation programme of one of Europe's eleven ESA Business Incubation Centres (BICs). The overall winner - the Copernicus Master - was selected from among the winners of each challenge (except the Best Service Challenge) by a panel of experts.

Just wondering if there's any prior work on using icecast to broadcast
directly from SuperCollider to the internet? I run an icecast server
and it'd be nice in future to think about connecting some live SC
sound, directly to the broadcast.

we're actually running sc2 under classic mode + shoutcast for an old
installation that has gained new life online. as jack can't access classic
soundmanager we use a dodgy hardware solution with a minitele cable from
speaker -> micin and then the shoutcast~ external (pd|max) to encode.
it works
great believe it or not!
but with sc server it'd be better to jack directly into pd|max. that

Five Years Ago the iPad Changed Clicks to Touches--but Another Tablet Revolution Is Coming

The Conversation (04/03/15) Jason Alexander

Next-generation displays are expected to evolve from the flat, two-dimensional form factor popularized by the iPad into three-dimensional (3D) tablets equipped with self-actuated, physically reconfigurable surfaces, writes Lancaster University lecturer Jason Alexander. He says these deformable flat screens will be capable of changing the shape of their display surface to better represent on-screen content and offer more ways to convey information tactilely instead of only visually. Computer interaction will undergo a fundamental transformation via the advent of dynamic physical geometry, as physically protruding pixels will enable developers to augment applications such as architecture, design, terrain modeling, and photography by rendering computer-generated 3D scenes in three dimensions. Alexander says this will create opportunities for unique applications in team collaboration, tangible entertainment, and ways of improving computer access for the disabled. He notes Lancaster University researchers have developed an interactive bar chart to represent common data visualization tasks such as displaying and filtering data, organizing it into rows and columns, navigating between large datasets, and producing annotations. They determined the physical nature of dynamic bars encouraged users to directly manipulate data points for annotation and comparison-style tasks, and that traditional touch-based controls are conducive to navigation and organization. Non-technical researchers can experiment with reconfigurable displays via ShapeClip, which adds a z-axis to a computer screen's x- and y-axes.

I’ve been interested in gender issues in computer gaming for many years. In 1996, after 4 years of qualitative research with over 1000 girls and boys throughout the US, I co-founded Purple Moon, a company to create interactive media explicitly for 8-12-year-old girls. This was the “girl games” moment with many entries into the field from such companies as Her Interactive and Mattel with “Barbie Fashion Designer.” Purple Moon’s first mission was to learn as much as we could about how girls play and then to create interactive experiences that took advantage of these insights in order to encourage girls to put their hands on the machine. In this period, girls were extremely reluctant to play computer games and were generally both afraid of the technology and afflicted with the belief that using it would be gender-transgressive. As we did the interviews, however, another goal emerged that would overshadow the first. We saw the opportunity to meet girls where they were (including their social structures, dreams and fears). We strove to encourage through play a cultural intervention to counter the sort of female gender identity as promulgated by the enforcers of a consumerist, sexist status quo (exemplified by Mattel).

We decided to make a cultural intervention in the definition of femininity itself, including stereotypes about beauty, proper behavior, intelligence, social interaction and self-esteem. Purple Moon lasted for about 3 years until its investors pulled their funding to move to web-based enterprises that promised greater valuations and profits. Just as we released our eighth game we were suddenly taken into Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We raided our real estate deposit to be sure that all 40+ employees went home with a paycheck that day. Later, we persuaded our investors to choose Chapter 11 bankruptcy instead so that the company might be sold. Purple Moon was eventually acquired and killed by Mattel, as were most of the girl game properties of the time, and the party was over. However, I still get mail at least once a week from former Purple Moon players thanking me for our efforts and testifying to the positive differences the games made in their lives. Usually I send them a copy of my book Utopian Entrepreneur that talks about how the sausage was made.

More recently, I have done design research with my students on such topics as the construction of masculinity in relation to media with 6-year-old boys. I have just finished another design research project with my UCSC game design students looking at ways to make interventions for kids with math anxiety. Over the last three years I have become more closely affiliated with feminists in games as well as with the queer games movement. I believe that games can serve to disrupt stereotypes – most importantly, the stereotypes that young people apply to themselves. I also believe that the current efflorescence in queer gaming reflects a desire to create social and personal spaces where one feels safe and happy in one’s own skin. I see games as a powerful force for cultural intervention in stereotypical identities and as places where one may investigate alternative versions of one’s own identity.

  The country is prone to recurrent natural disasters such as drought, floods and locust invasions, which have grown increasingly frequent and severe. In addition, desertification in drought-prone areas is rapidly spreading and the impact of climate change is increasingly affecting the availability of water and pasture.
  Food insecurity and malnutrition rates remain chronically high. In 2013, Burkina Faso ranked 65 out of 78 on the global hunger index. In addition, while the 2012/2013 harvest showed a significant improvement compared to the previous harvest and the five-year average, populations are still recovering from the 2012 food and nutrition crisis. The government’s response plan for 2014 indicated that 1,330,000 people are vulnerable to food insecurity and 7,300 remain affected by the flooding that occurred in 2013. In addition, the influx of Malian refugees into the country that started in 2012 has generated additional challenges for food security in Burkina Faso, not only for the refugees, but also for the communities surrounding refugee settlements.

Space Scientists Create Common Data Hub, Universal Language for Mission Data
Austrian Academy of Sciences (04/10/15)

A consortium of European researchers have debuted a new common data hub that will enable space scientists to compare data from numerous different space missions. This task has previously been very difficult because space missions often use purpose-built instruments, as well as data acquisition and number-crunching tools that are built using mission-specific data structures and protocols; this results in reams of data that cannot be easily compared against data from other missions. The new IMPEx portal provides space scientists with a single point of access to a suite of tools designed to make searching for, visualizing, and comparing space mission data much easier. The new portal will enable scientists to better understand complex observational data and to compare computer-simulated data with actual observational data. The tools provided by IMPEx include the CDPP AMDA (Automated Multi-Dataset Analysis) tool, which offers scientists easy-to-use data-mining capabilities. Another tool is CDPP 3DView, which offers three-dimensional visualization capabilities for data such as spacecraft trajectories and planetary ephemerides. The first application of the IMPEx tools was a detailed comparison of observational data from the European Space Agency's Venus Express mission and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Messenger mission to Mercury against existing simulation models.

Black holes - bigger on the inside

Guess what: black holes are bigger inside than they look - and they get bigger as they get older!

For example, take the big black hole in the center of our galaxy, called Sagittarius A*.  It's about 2 million kilometers across.  That's pretty big - but the orbit of Mercury is 60 times bigger.  This black hole is old, roughly a billion years old.  And here's the cool part:  it's been growing on the inside  all this time!

How is this possible?  Well, since spacetime is severely warped in a black hole, its volume can be bigger than you'd guess from outside.  And its volume can change.  Since we understand general relativity quite well, we can calculate how this works!  But nobody thought of doing it until last year, when Marios Christodoulou and my friend Carlo Rovelli did it.

How big is the black hole at the center of our galaxy?  On the inside, it can hold a million solar systems!  Its volume is about 10^34 cubic kilometers!   And it's growing at a rate of about 10^25 cubic kilometers per year!

Or suppose you have an ordinary star that turns into a black hole.  This black hole will last a long time before it evaporates due to Hawking radiation.  Christodolou and Rovelli estimate how big its volume will get before this happens.  And it gets really big - bigger than the current-day observable universe!

Before you get too excited, remember: people falling into the black hole will not have time to do anything fun inside.  They will hit the singularity in a short time.  Very very roughly speaking, the problem is not the shortage of space inside the black hole, it's the shortage of time.

If you fall into the black hole at the center of our galaxy, it will be about 1 minute, at most, before you hit the singularity.   You will not get to see most of the space inside the black hole!   The singularity is not in the 'middle' of the black hole - it's in your future.  You will hit it before you can reach the 'middle'.  So, you will only get to see part of the 'edge regions' inside the black hole.

The 'middle regions' can only be seen by people who fell in much earlier.  And they can't see the 'edge', where you are!

And now for the serious part.

The hard part of this problem is defining the volume inside a black hole.

If you choose a moment in time, the black hole's event horizon at that moment is a sphere.  There are infinitely many ways to extend this sphere to a solid ball.  In other words: there are many ways to choose a slice of space inside the black hole whose boundary is your chosen sphere.

The slice can bend forwards in time, or backwards in time.  We can choose a wiggly slice or a smooth one.  Each slice has its own volume.

How do you choose one, so you can calculate its volume? Christodoulou and Rovelli choose the one with the largest volume. This may sound like it's cheating.  But it's not.

Think of a simpler problem one dimension down.  You have a loop of wire.  You ask me: "What's the area of the surface whose boundary is this loop?"

I say: "That's a meaningless question!  Which surface?  There are lots!"

You say: "Pick the best one!"

So, it's up to me.   I take some soapy water and make a soap film whose boundary is that loop.  That's the surface I use.   If the loop of wire is not too crazy in its shape, this surface is uniquely defined.   In some sense it's the "least wiggly" surface I could choose.

This surface minimizes the area.  A more wiggly surface would have more area.

Christodoulou and Rovelli are doing the same thing.  But spacetime is different than space!   If you choose a wiggly 3-dimensional spatial surface in spacetime, it will have less volume than a flatter surface with the same boundary!

So, the way to pick the flattest, nicest spatial surface inside our black hole is to pick the one that maximizes the volume.

If you tried to minimize the volume, you could get it as close to zero as you wanted.  And this would have nothing to do with black holes!   This would be true even in your living room.

Puzzle: why?

Here's the paper:

You can now make your own cyborg roach for just $100.   Just buy this kit developed by the company Backyard Brains:

Are you a teacher or parent that wants to teach a student about advanced neurotechnologies? You are in luck! After 3 long years of R&D, the RoboRoach is now ready for its grand release! We are excited to announce the world's first commercially available cyborg! With our RoboRoach you can briefly wirelessly control the left/right movement of a cockroach by microstimulation of the antenna nerves. The RoboRoach is a great way to learn about neural microstimulation, learning, and electronics!

We are recently ran a successfully-funded kickstarter campaign to fund the release of our new RoboRoach! The hardware and firmware development are complete and we are now shipping!

Product Details

The RoboRoach "backpack" weighs 4.4 grams with the battery, and each battery will last over a month! Following a brief surgery you perform on the cockroach to attach the silver electrodes to the antenna, you can attach the backpack to the roach and control its movement for a few minutes before the cockroach adapts. When you return the cockroach to its cage for ~20 minutes, he "forgets" and the stimulation works again. Once you receive your RoboRoach in the mail, follow our online surgery instructions and videos and you will soon be on your way to becoming an expert in neural interfaces. After about 2-7 days, the stimulation stops working altogether, so you can clip the wires and retire the cockroach to your breeder colony to spend the rest of its days making more cockroaches for you and eating your lettuce.

Technical Specs

- 1x Free iOS or Android 4.3+ application for remote control
- 1x Bluetooth Roboroach backpack control unit
- 1x 1632 RoboRoach Battery
- 3x Electrode Sets (to implant 3 Roaches)

View our RoboRoach Ethics Statement

Backyard Brains has developed ethical guidelines for all our products. You can read more in our statement regarding our use of insect for experiments at:

http://ethics.backyardbrains.com

I feel ethical qualms about taking away the autonomy of an animal this way, and their ethics statement doesn't really address that.  This is the closest they come:

Criticism: Modifying a living creature to make a toy is wrong.

The RoboRoach circuit is not a toy. This new bluetooth version is a powerful low-cost tool for studying neural circuits, allowing for students to make discoveries. High school students in New York, for example, have discovered random stimulation causes much slower adaptation times. We have scientist and high school educator colleagues who are mentoring students in novel behavioral experiments using the RoboRoach circuit. Some highlights will be posted on our website soon.

By focusing on the question of whether the RoboRoach is a "toy", they dodge the harder question of when it's okay to override the nervous system of an animal and make it do what you want.  Perhaps feeling a bit nervous about this, some of the cyborg roach developers say they want to use it as a "rescue robot" that can crawl around and hear people trapped under collapsed buildings.  I think most people would say this is okay, at least if it actually works.

For a critical view on the ethics, see:

Founded on significant research into the physiological basis of behaviour, Biohistory is a ground-breaking scientific theory that presents an innovative investigation of the role of epigenetics in the history of civilisations from the Roman Empire to the present day. The book takes a fresh and original approach to exploring the factors that caused different civilisations to prosper and decline, and, through his analysis of human biology and the genetic causes of behaviour, Penman arrives at a startling conclusion: Western civilisation is in a state of decline and collapse.

This is no shock tactic; Penman uses empirical, scientific data to present the first testable study of the role that biological factors played in the history of the West, based on the physiological mechanisms that change behaviour based on varying food conditions. Biohistory draws on the disciplines of history, biology, anthropology and economics to explain the effects of epigenetic differences on cultures, and how social change can even be predicted through biochemistry.

2. http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/26911/how-to-install-emacs24-4-on-a-raspberry-pi-model-b

I installed dependencies by trial-and-error until the compile succeeded.  I installed the version without x.

***** Step 1: Install dependencies

Before downloading Emacs 24 and installing with the instructions that follow in step 2, you must install dependencies.  I followed the instructions from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSnapshotAndDebian but the instructions from the links cited above may be better.

The dependencies cited by the second of the above links, namely http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/26911/how-to-install-emacs24-4-on-a-raspberry-pi-model-b, are:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

***** Step 2: Download and install EMACS 24
http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/26911/how-to-install-emacs24-4-on-a-raspberry-pi-model-b

- Download it from GNU: wget http://gnu.mirrors.linux.ro/emacs/emacs-24.4.tar.gz
- Unzip:tar -xzvf emacs-24.4.tar.gz
- Navigate to the unzipped directory
- Type ./configure
  - Note: If you are running Raspbian without X (X windows system + libraries), then add --without-x as argument to the command.
- After the command from step 4 is done, type: make
- Finally type in terminal: sudo make install

I have some JQuery code that shows or hides a div.

$("div#extraControls").show();   // OR .hide()
I initially want the div to be not visible so I used:

$(document).ready(function() {
    $("div#extraControls").hide();
});
However, on the browser, the content loads visible for a second before disappearing, which is not what I want.

How do I set the hide the element before the page loads whilst keeping the ability to show hide it dynamically with a script?

div.hidden
{
   display: none
}

<div id="extraControls" class="hidden">
</div>

$(document).ready(function() {
    $("div#extraControls").removeClass("hidden");
});

+1 One thing to note is that if the user has disabled JavaScript in the browser, the whole page stays hidden. –  Kimmo Puputti Jun 1 '10 at 16:20

From my experience some browsers will not load media (eg. images) in elements which are hidden using display:none or opacity:0. I'd recommend using visibility:hidden instead. –  mqchen Jun 1 '10 at 16:45

@mq.chen Thanks for the warning, however the visibility tag does not allow the content to be toggled with the .hide() command. –  Robert Jun 3 '10 at 12:09

In CSS:

#extraControls { display: none; }
Or in HTML:

<div id="extraControls" style="display: none;"></div>

Make a css class

.hidden {
display: none;
}
Add this to any element you don't want to be visible when loading the page. Then use $("div#extraControls").show(); to display it again.

#toggleMe //Keep this in your .css file
{
display:none;
visibility:inherit;
background-color:#d2d8c9;
}


 <a href="#" onclick="return false;">Expand Me</a>
 ///this way u can make a link to act like a button too

 <div id="toggleMe">  //this will be hidden during the page load
  //your elements
 </div>

///if you decide to make it display on a click, follow below:
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"> </script> //make sure u include jquery.js file in ur project
<script type="text/javascript">
 $(document).ready(function () {
        $("a").click(function () {
            $('#toggleMe').toggle("slow"); //Animation effect
        });
    });
</script>

///Now for every alternate click, it shows and hides, but during page load; its hidden.
//Hope this helps you guys ...

What you could do is insert a inline script tag at the end of the document, or immediately after the div with id "extraControls". Should be fire a little sooner than.

<div id="extraControls">i want to be invisible!</div>
<script type="text/javascript">$("div#extraControls").hide()</script>
Of course you could do this server-side as well, but maybe there's a good reason you don't want to do that (like, have the controls visible if the browser does NOT support javascript).

With CSS3 you can actually hide content until a page loads by taking advantage of the :only-child selector.

Here is a demonstration of how to do this. The basic idea is that CSS while loading will add a single node to the DOM while loading that node and its child nodes. Further, once a second child is added to the given parent node the :only-child selector rule is broken. We match against this selector and set display: none to hide the given node.

<!doctype html>

<html>

  <head>
    <title>Hide content until loaded with CSS</title>
    <style type="text/css" media="screen">
      .hide-single-child > :only-child {
        display: none;
      }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class='hide-single-child'>
      <div>
        <h1>Content Hidden</h1>
        <script>
          alert('Note that content is hidden until you click "Ok".');
        </script>
      </div>
      <div></div>
    </div>
  </body>

</html>
