Konzentration

Gönnen Sie Ihrem Gehirn eine Pause
Das Gehirn erholt sich im Schlaf. Klar. Aber nicht nur. Auch im Wachzustand sind regelmässige Pausen wichtig.

Regelmässige Pausen sind keine verlorene Zeit.

Wer geistig über längere Zeit unter Strom steht, sollte immer wieder kleine oder auch längere Erholungsphasen einbauen. Das ist kein unnötiger Zeitverlust, im Gegenteil. Nichtstun ist eine wichtige Voraussetzung für Kreativität und Produktivität. Wer sein Potential nutzen will, muss ausruhen, die Gedanken schweifen lassen. Nur gönnen die Menschen sich viel zu wenige Pausen.

Kreativitätsforscher Ernst Pöppel, Chef des Münchner Instituts für Medizinische Psychologie (IMP), spricht gar von einem «Kreativitätsstau». Pöppel ist überzeugt, dass unsere Gesellschaft «geradezu explodieren könnte, wenn alle täglich eine Stunde aus dem Kommunikationszwang aussteigen würden».

Mach mal Pause!
Folgende Arten von Pausen haben sich für Studierende bewährt. In angepasster Form haben sie auch im Arbeitsprozess Gültigkeit:

Kurze Gedankenpausen/Verschnaufpausen: Damit können Sie Gelerntes abschliessen und die Verarbeitungsprozesse im Gehirn fangen an.
Minipausen: 5 Minuten alle 30 Minuten: kurz aufzustehen, einige Bewegungsübungen machen.
Kurzpausen: Spätestens nach 2 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie 15 bis 20 Minuten Pause machen. Tun Sie nichts ausser etwas trinken und vielleicht etwas (leichtes) essen.
Freizeitpausen: Nach 3 bis 4 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie sich 1 bis 2 Stunden lang erholen und diese freie Zeit bewusst geniessen.

Wundermittel Schlaf
Das wichtigste für ein leistungsfähiges Gehirn ist die regelmässige Nachtruhe. Das Gehirn nutzt und braucht den Schlaf, um zu verarbeiten, was es tagsüber geleistet hat. Mehr noch. Viele Probleme lösen sich geradezu über Nacht. Viele Menschen kommen beim Aufwachen oft auf Lösungen, die ihm am Vortag noch unlösbar schienen. Schlafforscher erklären das Phänomen so: Der Schlaf dient dazu, überflüssige Nervenverknüpfungen abzubauen und neue zu festigen. Im Schlaf überführt das Gehirn zudem neue Informationen vom Zwischenspeicher ins Langzeitgedächtnis verankert sie da.

Sport treiben und gesund essen
Das Gehirn kann sich aber auch aktiv erholen. Sport kann Ihnen helfen, Ihre Konzentration zu verbessern. Denn Sport kurbelt nicht nur den Stoffwechsel an, sondern verbessert auch die Sauerstoffzufuhr, was der Konzentrationsfähigkeit dient.

Wichtig für das Gehirn ist auch eine gesunde Ernährung. Am besten sind fünf kleinere Mahlzeiten regelmässig über den Tag verteilt. So bleibt Ihr Blutzuckerspiegel stabil. Denn ein tiefer Blutzuckerspielge führt zu Konzentrationsmangel und Leistungsabfall. Nebst genügend Kohlenhydraten, Eiweiss, Vitaminen und pflanzlichen ungesättigten Fetten braucht das Gehirn aber auch genügend Flüssigkeit wie Wasser, ungesüssten Tee oder verdünnte Fruchtsäfte. Lebensmittel, die besonders gut für Ihr Gehirn sind, finden Sie auf dem Merkblatt «Brainfood».

Nahrungsergänzungsmittel
Aufbau- und Vitaminpräparate sind eine sinnvolle Ergänzung zur ausgewogenen Ernährung. Vor allem, wenn beispielsweise nach einer Krankheit ein erhöhter Bedarf an Mineralien, Vitaminen und Spurenelementen besteht.

Vitamine: Vitamin C kann stimulieren. Die B-Vitamine unterstützen die Funktion des Nervensystems und setzen Energie aus Kohlenhydraten frei, die es für die korrekte Funktion der Hirnzellen braucht.
Pflanzliche Stoffe: Ginseng oder Ginkgo biloba können die Konzentration verbessern, indem sie die Durchblutung der Hirnzellen fördern. Bestimmte Lebensmittel respektive Gewürze wie Knoblauch, Zwiebeln, Kohl oder Cayennepfeffer fördern ebenfalls die Durchblutung.
Kaffee, Guarana und Cola wirken wegen ihres Koffeingehaltes stimulierend.

Marcel Duchamp by Man Ray (1920) & Etoile cosmique (1923) by Raymond Roussel

 « My soul is a strange factory » -Raymond Roussel

New Impressions of Raymond Roussel points us towards an intellectual history that maps out art’s role in creating a social allegory for the poetic psychoanalysis[1] of mechanized pleasure – in circular struggle with the mechanized mass killings of World War I and II, the holocaust, and Hiroshima. And the rewards of such exhausting circularity are considerable, given both the historical significance of Raymond Roussel’s influence and its unapologetic relevance to today’s cyber culture – with its intransigent obliqueness and mechanical dizziness.

But if I were going to generate an art exhibition as homage to a particularly flamboyant artist,[2] even if un peu obscur, I would think that it would be advantageous to try to match the aesthetic qualities of that person (absurdly intricate mechanical interlacings) with the show’s general aesthetic. Unfortunately, that was not the least bit achieved with the homage to the wildly creative dandy writer Raymond Roussel (1877-1933)[3] that is at the Palais de Tokyo centre d’art contemporain in Paris.

While access to much of the remarkable work here (including five of Roussel’s otherworldy hand written manuscript pages for his last book Comment j’ai écrit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books) and a wonderful cookie-encasing sculpture memento called Etoile cosmique (Cosmic Star) – a glass and silver case that Roussel had made for a star-shaped biscuit he brought back from lunch in Juvisy-sur-Orge with the astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842-1925) on July 29, 1923) is to be appreciated and relished, the cavernous half-finished Level 1 Galerie Seine devoured and neutralized any stylistic moods of gamesmanship that are associated with Roussel: such as the famously extravagant, yet intricately hermetic, elaborate mechanamorphic constructions that verged on the exuberantly preposterousness of a machine running infinitely wild. Perhaps if I had seen the other two manifestations of this show – Impressions of Raymond Roussel held at the Museo Reina Sofia (Madrid) in 2011 and the Museu Serralves (Porto) in 2012 – I may not have felt so disappointed in the general lack of neurotic deliriousness experienced in this one.

Granted that Raymond Roussel’s disregard for financial restraint[4] cannot be matched by the Palais de Tokyo, but still the gutted construction materials hanging overhead in this ugly cavernous space takes the eye and mind out of the magnificently intricate labyrinthine quality typical of his extravagant writings: as established in the prose work Impressions d’Afrique (1910) (a work that features a painting machine that duplicates the color spectrum of the sky at dawn),[5] Locus Solus (1914) (like Impressions d’Afrique, written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns) and the obsessive but convulsingly poetic Nouvelle Impressions d’Afrique (1932).[6] Thus the larger the art (even as it was needed to fill this mammoth half-raw space) the worse it connected to Roussel’s sense of virtual impenetrability through mechanical precision.

Mike Kelly’s lumbering black cave Kandors 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude) (2011) and Rodney Graham’s Camera Obscura Mobile (1995-1996) installation were particularly unmatched to Roussel’s obsessive minute attention; a concentration that is capable of whirling together copious narratives from a veiled network of murky puns and obscured double entendres in a way that anticipates Oulipian. Mark Manders’s steamy black connectivist sculpture Mind Study (2011), Giuseppe Gabellone’s beautiful silver sculpture L’Assetalo (Thirsty Man) (2008) and Jacques Carelman’s droll motion sculpture Le Diamont (The Dimond) (1975) worked only a bit better in reinforcing a spirit of intricate mechanicalness as they each ate up almost an entire room. A relatively fascinating installation by André Maranha, Pedro Morais, Jorge Queiroz and Francisco Tropa called Tres Moscas (Three Flies) (2012) did eat an entire room and only delivered limited thematic power in terms of absurd interlacing.

Much more capable of such finicky and arcane mesmerizing rhythms was the more intimate yet preposterous work of Thomas Bayrle (his deadpan pulsating romantic machine Spatz von Paris (2011) is one of the highlights of the show). Rodney Graham’s series of books called The System worked well in the context and it was captivating to see displays of the literary journal Revue Locus Solus, established by American writers John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, Kenneth Koch and James Shuyler. Published in Paris between 1961 and 1962, the journal formed a bridge between French authors, both historical and contemporary, and writers from the New York School and the Beat Generation. The Collège de Pataphysique was represented by the writer Jean Ferry who published several studies devoted to Roussel, including L’Afrique des Impressions, a detailed analysis which consists of considering the text as instructions for users and reconstructing, in the form of maps, diagrams and schedules, the journeys and events that took place at Ponukélé, an imaginary place in Roussel’s Africa. Two comical cosmic Joseph Cornell boxes, Blue Sand Box and Sand Fountain from the early 1950s pleased me, as they bracketed a stream of photographed drawings of fantastic imaginary architecture from 1857 by Victorien Sardou – as did an early Pataphysical video by Jean-Christophe Averty. The irascible Salvador Dalí is represented with his short motion picture Impressions de la Haute Mongolie (1975), made with the filmmaker José Montes-Baquer. Dalí read Roussel’s books as early as the 1920s and Roussel had a great influence on Dalí’s “critical paranoia” method. Dalí, who died with a copy of Impressions d’Afrique on his bedside table, believed him to be one of France’s greatest writers ever. Jean Tinguely is inserted, rightly, into this mix with a brain-teasing manic lithograph from 1966-67 called Requiem pour une feuille morte (Requiem for a Dead Leaf), rather than an expected endless drawing machine contraption, that would have more directly interlocked with Roussel’s imagined painting machine.

And Roussel’s major inspiration (along with novelist and naval officer Pierre Loti), the author Jules Verne, has a wacky lithograph of a flat globe studded with images entitled Around the World in Eighty Days from 1880. Roussel greatly admired the works of Verne – which he read over and over again, fascinated with their extraodinary voyages and machines, full of bachelor scientists completely absorbed in positivist exploratory dreams taken to delirious extremes. At that scale of interlacing, some of the hypnotic effect of Roussel’s capacious playful circularity is possible to feel.

However, Gabriele Di Matteo’s contribution to the show’s circularity is essential. His hand-painted over digital-painting Marcel Duchamp, a life in pictures by André Raffray illustrates the time when Duchamp attended a showing of Impressions d’Afrique in 1912, an experience Duchamp would describe as revelatory. As Gabriele Di Matteo depicts, Duchamp, along with Guillaume Appollinaire, Picabia and Picabia’s wife Gabrielle Buffet, attended a performance of Impressions of Africa: the play by Roussel based on his book. Duchamp later credited Roussel with the inspiration for his The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass). There are several original notes by Duchamp and a drawing that he made for The Large Glass in 1912-1915 in the show, as well as quite a few photos of Duchamp with The Large Glass. Among them is the striking photo of Duchamp that was taken by Man Ray in 1920 that shows a star carved out in Duchamp’s hair. This work connects ludicrously well with Roussel’s star shaped cookie piece, Etoile cosmique, from just three years later.

Historically, the mechanamorphic impulse behind Marcel Duchamp’s works from 1912 (that derived a good deal from Roussel) is of great significance. That is when Duchamp started producing paintings and drawings depicting mechanized sex acts such as Mechanics of Modesty and The Passage from the Virgin to the Bride – and the fantastic machine-body work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even that follow his exposure to the play Impressions d’Afrique – is an inescapable point of reference for the avant-garde of the 20th century. The same may be said for Francis Picabia (who has a room of paintings all to himself at the show La Collection Michael Werner just a stone throw away at the Musée d’Art Moderne Ville de Paris).

The elaborateness of the machine, for Duchamp and Picabia, became the symbol of sexual bliss[7] attainable through concept connected to auto-sexual autonomy in contradiction to the horror that mechanized war had brought. By hypnotizing attention, the machine freed them from troubling obsessions and personal hang-ups through the alternative model of android life; intimating both our rush of desperation and our ecstatic release, refracted through a web of glazed impersonality. If the machine, as a representative of order, was a fascination Duchamp and Picabia used to balance out the age’s clumsiness, whether of the mind or flesh, Roussel’s mechanamorphic production and machine forms refigured the human body into an almost mechanized substance.

In The Bride Stripped Bare by the Bachelors, Even, which positions a central bride machine over a bachelor apparatus, Duchamp, with the strictness of machinery, applies fantasy to seduction and masturbation. In a way, Duchamp suggests that we (as viewers) can use his art as a vehicle for self-transcendence into a kind of dream world of nonsense sex. This rabbit-hole logic he took from Roussel.

So New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it outlines an eccentric expanding circular history of 20th-century art, linking the points between artists and writers who have talked of the influence of this author and his writings on their work: starting with Dada (Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia), then André Breton and the Surrealists (like Michel Leiris, Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau) to Neo-Dada Nouveau réalisme (Jean Tinguely) through Oulipo (Georges Perec) Pataphysicians (Jean Ferry, Jean-Christophe Averty and the Collège de Pataphysique) and the authors of the nouveau roman (like Alain Robbe-Grillet). As noted above, his most direct influence in the English-speaking world was on the New York School of poets John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler, and Kenneth Koch.

Writing as art – or – art as writing: this is the theoretical ripe fruit plucked from Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel – art theory as art – made conceivable by Roussel’s inventions of language machines that produced texts through the use of repetitions and combination/permutations. This machine-like logic provides art with a seemingly pure spectacle of endless variety of textual games and combinations flowing in circular form. (We see and feel this most fully, however, in the sprawling and dazzling Julio Le Parc kinetic op art retrospective on the first floor of the Palais de Tokyo, rather than in this show.)

And there are lessons here for painting, also. Within this writing process Roussel described a number of fantastic machines, including a painting machine in his novel Impressions of Africa. This painting machine wonderfully describes and foresees the arrival of computer-robotic technology and it’s application to visual art which we have available to us today, a century after he envisioned it.

The web also regenerates deep connections to the past; so cyberspace, this territory which stretches out from hypertext to the world-wide computer network, from virtual reality to video games, might also be theorized as the domain of Roussel’s idea of reduplicating without duplication, reiterating without repeating: his game-of-mirrors cosmos. His is a strident activity lost in an infinite navigation from one sort of encounter to another in which the affirmation of the other keeps appearing and disappearing in the play of mechanical maneuvers (or mechanisms) destined to avert gratification. This is where the bachelor apparatus of Duchamp repeats itself ad infinitum by transmitting the machine via an alter-ego.

But too, New Impressions of Raymond Roussel reminds us that Raymond Roussel’s themes and procedures also involved imprisonment and liberation, exoticism, cryptograms and torture by language – all formally reflected in his working technique with its inextricable play of double images, repetitions, and impediments, all giving the impression of the pen running on by itself through the dreamy usage and baroque play of mirrored form.

Roussel’s running on repetition technique, as used in the Thomas Bayrle sculpture, for example, lends itself well to the creation of unforeseen, automatic and spontaneously art which gives me the feeling of prolonging action into eternity through the ceaseless, fantastic constructions of the work itself, transmitting an altered, exalted and orgasmic state of mind which after the initial dazzling creates one predominant overall effect: that of creating doubt through mechanical discourse.

The image of enclosure is common with Roussel where a secret to a secret is held back, systematically imposing a formless anxiety in the reader through the labyrinthine extensions and doublings, disguises and duplications of his texts, which make all speech and vision undergo a moment of annihilation.

New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it presents to us through intimacy the model of quiet perfection of the eternally repetitive mechanical machine which functions independently of time and space, pulling us into a logic of the infinite. We can learn this from Roussel’s final rebus-like book, Comment j’ai écrit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books); the last of his conceptual machines, the machine which contains and repeats within its mechanism all those mental machines he had formerly described and put into motion, making evident the machine which produced all of his machines – the master machine.[8] All of these machines map out an eccentric spiral space that is circular in nature and thus an abstract attempt at eliminating time. They reproduce the old myths of departure, of loss and of return. They construct a crisscrossed mechanical map of the two great mythic spaces so often explored by western imagination: space that is rigid and forbidden, containing the quest, the return and the treasure (for example the geography of the Argonauts and the labyrinth) – and the other space of polymorphosis noise: the visible transformation of instantly crossed frontiers and borders, of strange affiliations, of spells, and of symbolic replacements (the space of the Minotaur).

Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel potentially removes us out of our quiet and glib indolence and points us in the potent direction of expanding intensity. I believe that shows like Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel are critical to us now because the counter-mannerist excess found there may problematize the popular simulacra that art has become – and make the underground intricately-strange privateness of the human animal more lively.

Notes:
[1] At age 17, Roussel wrote Mon Âme, a long poem published three years later in Le Gaulois. By 1896, he had commenced editing his long poem La Doublure when he suffered a mental crisis. After the poem was published on June 10, 1897 and was completely unsuccessful, Roussel began to see the psychiatrist Pierre Janet.

[2] Poet, novelist, playwright, musician, and chess enthusiast

[3] Raymond Roussel was born in Paris in 1877. His writings, including the novels Impressions of Africa and Locus Solus and volumes of poetry and drama, were largely ignored in his lifetime, but have since been championed by the likes of Michel Leiris (whose father was Roussel’s accountant), Raymond Queneau, Alain Robbe-Grillet (his first novel, Le Voyeur, was originally titled La Vue in homage to Roussel’s long 1904 poem of the same name), Georges Perec, Harry Mathews, John Ashbery and Michel Foucault (Foucault wrote a critical study, Death and the Labyrinth, after the chance discovery of one of Roussel’s volumes in an antiquarian shop across from the Luxembourg Gardens). Roussel died under mysterious circumstances (apparently by suicide) in 1933 in Palermo, Sicily after he went broke chasing literary fame before his death – decades before his work began receiving the acceptance he craved. He is buried in Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

[4] In 1894, at age 16, he inherited a substantial fortune from his deceased father and began to write poetry to accompany his musical compositions. Tremendously wealthy, he took two world tours during which he hardly left his hotel rooms.

[5] The story told in Impressions of Africa is a nominally bare-bones fantasy. The shipwrecked inhabitants of the Lyseus, en route from Marseille to Argentina, are captured by an African potentate, Talou, who holds them hostage while awaiting their ransom. The ship’s manifest includes actors, singers, musicians, fearless naturalists, a slew of carpenters, and, fortuitously, a trove of instruments, lumber, scientific equipment, and trained animals. Partly to keep themselves busy, the motley Europeans, dubbing themselves the Incomparables, decide to stage a set of performances. Converging with their gala is Talou’s military triumph over a rival clan (and the execution of a handful of unloyal subjects). This is the back-story of Impressions of Africa, literally.

[6]  New Impressions of Africa is a 1,274-line poem, consisting of four long cantos in rhymed alexandrines, each a single sentence with parenthetical asides that run up to five levels deep. From time to time, a footnote refers to a further poem containing its own depths of brackets. Roussel worked and reworked the 1,274 lines of New Impressions of Africa over a seventeen-year period, rewriting each one as many as twenty times to accomplish a mordant succinctness.

[7] Around the same point in time, Dr. Freud was explaining in his lectures that complex machines that repeat in dreams signified the genital organs. Roussel’s descriptions of eggs on plates and the multiple allusions to the odor of urine after the eating of asparagus are typical of a poetic-mechanical apparatus helping to take us further into the area of the unconscious and the sexual.

[8] Roussel had kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, How I Wrote Certain of My Books, where he describes it as follows: “I chose two similar words. For example, billard (billiard) and pillard (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two sentences found, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.”

One Response to Review of Nouvelles Impressions de Raymond Roussel
G. W. Smith says:
April 14, 2013 at 11:12 pm
The appearance of Joseph Nechvatal’s byline in On-Verge, is, in one sense, paradoxical, for Dr. Nechvatal is by no means an emerging writer; indeed, he has had perhaps more of value to say, in scores of books and articles, than any other art theorist regarding the the survival of the thinking, breathing — and loving — individual within our modern technological matrix. This is amply demonstrated in the current review, of a show dedicated to one of those wonderful French intellectuals, Raymond Roussel, whose writings not only helped his fellow Europeans survive the mechanized horrors of the early twentieth century, but which also — through a type of verbal jujitsu — allowed them to retain their own hold on the indispensable machine — this to the great benefit of his followers including Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Jean Tinguely.

If, however, we take “On-Verge” to refer also to the dawn of a new post-postModernist age — in which the vitality and precision of technology is married to a humanistic sensibility — then the appearance of Dr. Nechvatal’s review is both appropriate — and welcomed.

Hi Eric,
thanks for the tip. I tried this already. Its printing but has some drawbacks. E.g. I use high resolution monitors in vertical (pivot) mode and a tiling window manager. calfw scales to the current buffer size and this is unfortunately not really compatible with printing. In summary this solution might have to many ways to go wrong.

However, I noticed a much more interesting way. calfw buffer look almost like org-tables. And voila saving the buffer as org-file and a minimum of modifications allows me to export the calendar with both the html and pdf exporter. I just try to tell org-mode/latex/html to keep the height of the rows constant and independent of the content of the cell. Guess if I get this right, everything could be done in a little piece of elisp.
Alternatively, Sakurai san may like to create an official cfw:export-view-to-org could be part of calfw-org. This would also allow people to archive calendar views in org-mode files.

Much of my pure syntactic research over the past few years is consolidated in Provocative Syntax. I'm continuing on with my investigations in this model of morphosyntax. Doug Wharram and I have begun to study how syntactic "provocation" and semantics interact in the interpretation of Inuktitut indefinites.

I've also published work on the nature of ergativity (with Jonathan Bobaljik) and on quotative inversion (with Chris Collins).

***** Pretend like you’re a human being
With the possible exception of artists and architects, no one is more full of shit than designers. We can find a way to justify anything. Blah blah blah. That means no matter what you end up with, you can come up with some reason why it’s a good design. The best advice I have for designers is to practice being not-designers: stop what you’re doing, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths and then look again like you’re just a regular person encountering this product/service/user interface/object/page/poster for the first time. Where do your eyes go? What do you think it is at first? How do you figure out what you are supposed to do?
***** Make it inevitable
There is some truth to that old Henry Ford aphorism “Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t — you’re right.”. If you can’t believe it, it’s probably not going to happen. However, I like to take that one step further and ensure that every action we take is one that assumes the desired outcome is inevitable. Do not make actions that are out of alignment with that inevitability. Do not allow judgements which contradict it. The more evidence you have — and everyone else has — that things will come out as planned, the more likely it will be so.
***** Every job you do has your signature on it
When I was around 10 or 11 years old, my father offered me $10 to move a cord of recently-delivered firewood from the driveway into the garage and stack it up inside (I am old; $10 was a great deal of money back then). I managed to get all the firewood inside but rather than it being stacked against the wall, it was more or less evenly distributed across the floor of the garage. I expected my payment, but instead got some advice: “Every job you do has your signature on it — do you really want to sign that?” I always remembered that and if I am going to do something, I make every effort to do it right. (I also properly stacked the wood afterwards, even though it took forever, and I got paid in the end.)
***** Everyone should always be trying to make it easier for everyone
I used to play in a band. Other people might have played team sports, or worked in a well-functioning restaurant. There’s something about working deeply, in real-time, with other people that’s both incredibly satisfying and enormously more effective than working alone. You need to be open for the pass, you need to hear the subtle rhythm shifts, you need to spot when someone else’s table needs the check … everyone should be taking account of what everyone else is doing and constantly modifying their own behaviour to better serve the team.
***** Know why you’re doing it
If you are just out to make money, god bless: I hope you make some money. If you just want awards or recognition or for others to think highly of you, I hope you get that too. But I don’t think anyone is really satisfied by fame or fortune. I find it incredibly satisfying (and gratifying, rewarding and pleasant) to honestly have done the best job I could have done on something and I believe that works for everyone else too. Being skillful and exercising your mastery is what you’re here to do. Doing anything less undermines the whole point of being alive.

EMPAC Research: A New Paradigm for Interactive Exploration of Data with Live Coding
from EMPAC @ Rensselaer PLUS  1 year ago / Creative Commons License: by sa  ALL AUDIENCES

Part 1: Exploring a Dark Data Set ( 13 min. )

Part 2: The Field Environment ( 10 min. )

Interactive data exploration - as opposed to documentation of research outcomes - requires a hard- and software environment that allows quick turn-around (as in live coding), accelerated graphics processing and projection (utilizing GPUs for data processing), an “agnostic” parsing of data, and the ability to tap into the endless existing libraries available on-line. This approach allows quick access to and navigation of “big data”.

The open-source software Field programming environment provides all of the above. It allows to quickly manipulate different representations of a given data set, to navigate representation interactively, to create animations and to discover new perspectives.

Mathematical processes applied to the data can be changed as quickly as the mapping in the visual domain. Other modalities of representation, like stereoscopic visual representation, immersive projections or auditory mapping can easily be accessed.

This video shows in its first part the exploration of a “dark data set”, where the source and desired evaluation of the data was not known to the researcher visualizing the data. It turned out to be the simulation output of a high-performance computing network topology (“Dragon Fly Network”). Immediately insights into the data were unfolding and allowed to discover properties in the simulation, which had gone unnoticed before.

The second part presents an overview over the Field environment.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Celebrating Einstein strives to communicate all of this beauty and excitement to the general public by bridging the gap between the sciences and the arts in both its design and end products. This event is a truly collaborative and interdisciplinary effort between the departments of physics, history, communication, music, film, photography, art, and architecture at Montana State University, Princeton University, and UCLA. These many different fields all use creativity to invent new ideas that deepen our understanding of the world. Einstein's iconic figure, the centennial of the discovery of his most important theory, and the imminent direct detection of his final prediction produce a perfect theme for Celebrating Einstein.

Celebrating Einstein includes several events: a public lecture series by world-renowned scientists, including University of Maryland's Jim Gates, recipient of the National Medal of Science and member of the President's Science Advisory Panel, and David Kaiser, a best-selling author and the head of the MIT Program in Science, Technology and Society; Celebrating Einstein in the Schools, a collection of K-12 classroom lessons and activities; the Black (W)hole art installation, featuring visualizations and sounds of a small black hole spiraling violently into a supermassive one; and the Shout Across Time live multimedia theatre show, which will feature a dance-company performance illustrating a lecture on general relativity, a live orchestra, playing an original composition inspired by gravitational waves, and an original film featuring numerical simulations of black hole collisions.

** Hidden Triple Concertos
From: http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV42-D.htm

Olivier Raap wrote (December 4, 1999):
Cantata BWV 99 "Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan" opens with a Coro movement that seems to be an arrangement of a part (allegro?) of such a lost triple concerto: a concerto in G for flute, oboe d'amore, violin, strings and continuo. Maybe some major parts of the original work are not used in the cantata, and the solo violin part is relatively unimportant. Perhaps the work originated as a double concerto for only flute and oboe d'amore. If that would be the matter, a second part (slow tempo) of this concerto could be found in the opening Coro of cantata BWV 125 "Mit Fried' und Freud' ich fahr' dahin". Those cantatas are composed in 1724 and 1725, relatively short after the Köthen years. Maybe a Köthen concerto that is lost is borrowed for composing them. I didn't find any 3rd movement yet.

Another triple concerto, a concerto in D for 2 oboes, bassoon and continuo, can be assembled. For the 1st movement (allegro?) we can use the opening Sinfonia of cantata BWV 42 "Am Abend aber desselbigen Sabbats" For the 2nd slow movement the alto aria "Wo zwei und drei" can be used, but much reconstruction work has to be done. As a final fast movement the opening Sinfonia of the Easter Oratorio is a good choice. The trumpets and timpani, that probably are added later, have to be omitted.

    Sole instance in cantatas is in [[BWV 152]] according to BCJ program notes, but see:
    http://violadamore.com/index.php/many-strings-attached.html :

    J S Bach wrote for the viola d'amore four times in his career, most notably in the St. John Passion,
    which, more than any other work, has kept the d'amore in the history books. Recent research supports
    the use of the G tuning for this work, that is, dgbd'g'd''; because sympathetic strings are not
    involved, the tuning need not be the tonic triad of the work. This G tuning is just one tone lower
    than tuning of two of the other works, BWV 36c and BWV 1055.

    The other occasions for which Bach used the viola d'amore are an aria from Cantata BWV 205, and the
    whole of Cantata 152. Five works and three different tunings; not even Bach's use of the viola
    d'amore is straightforward. One of these obligato arias, "Auch mit Gedaempfted Schwachen Stimmen"
    from Cantata 36c, is in the A tuning which I have used as the basis for my transcription of the
    Flute Partita. If Kai Koepp theory about BWV 1055 is correct , Bach's Concerto for the Viola d'amore
    would have been in the A tuning as well.

Note that the continuo starts in fis and ends in c: Tritonus!
*** BWV 91 p30 Aria for Violino I, II (Tutti), Soprano + Alto modulates from e to c
- e minor is main tonality of piece. The piece modulates to g minor (minor third higher), then c minor (major third lower) in page 30.

- Apart from that it contains second-dissonances in the dialog of Soprano and Alto and chromatic passages in all voices. The middle part of the aria before the da capo ends in a minor.

** Common harmonic chains and progressions
** Use of canon and fugue
*** BWV 137
    Aria for bass and soprano. Canonic entries in pairs for both voices and for the oboes.
    But the canon is not sustained beyond the initial bars.

*** BWV 83 aria/recitativo for bass, continuo and unisono vln I,II, vla.
    The canon lasts only for initial 8 bars or so and then is followed by repeated imitation passages of
    of the initial phrase in different intervals and degrees. The longer canon passage is repeated in
    the final part of the aria.
*** BWV 80.7 Duetto Alto Tenore: Canon Oboe da c. Vln,
Repeated alternating short canons in entries of Oboe da c. + Vln, always in fifth interval.

** Unusual and strong dissonances
   BWV 101.2 complex dissonances and chromatic passages. Dissonances mainly caused by appogiatura
   motiv.
   BWV 5.4 Recitativo with the chorale melody played by the trumpet. Striking dissonances between
   trumpet part and continuo. (may be wrong about 5 could be number of bcj volume!)
** Unusual and striking endings
*** BWV 196.5 ending with 2 recorders alone, in parallel thirds and third downward leap
*** BWV 71.7 (Coro) Das Neue Regiment. Mvt ends with 2 recorders in unisono upward leap of perfect fourth.
    Note: there may be at least one more similar ending with solo brief motiv.

    And notes on ending in: http://www.bach.org/bach101/cantatas/cantata106b.html
    Endings of alto and bass vocal parts with downward dim fifth leaps,
    onto a dim seventh chord on e over a basso continuo of held eighths on f, then the soprano
    ends the piece alone with a cantilena closing on the major third of f (a), then a whole bar of
    silence!

** Unusual or strinking basso continuo lines
   122.2 Aria (basso) - O Menschen, die ihr taeglich suendigt.
   also in the cantata following this in the bjc series of cds?

** Unusual or striking recitativi

    Interesting dissonance effects in recorders ... interesting ending.
*** [[BWV 73]].1 Recitativo built in initial chorus see: [[*BWV 73.1: Initial chorus with repeated opening motiv and recitativo]]

   The story of Bach's cantatas begins with his first employment at the age of 18, in August of 1703,
   when he was appointed organist to the New Church in Arnstadt having recently dazzled the
   congregation with his brilliant performance at the dedication of their new organ. While his duties
   as organist did not require the composition of cantatas, Bach nevertheless produced some of his
   earliest choral works at this time, including Cantata 150, and the Easter Cantata 4. Also
   significant during his Arnstadt years is the celebrated story of his unauthorized 3-4 month absence
   in 1705 to hear the famous organist-composer Buxtehude in Lübeck; Bach's earliest cantatas owe a
   considerable debt to the inspiration and musical formats of Buxtehude.

   Moving to Mühlhausen in July 1707, he produced the Wedding Cantata 196. He remained there only a
   year, after which he accepted a two-fold position as member of the chamber orchestra and as organist
   to the Ducal Court at Weimar. At least 20 cantatas can be established with reasonable certainty as
   dating from this period, including Cantata 182, the Christmas Cantata 142, Cantatas 12, 18, 21, and
   the Easter Cantata 31.

   Bach's next move was to the small Court of Anhalt-Cöthen, where he took up the position of
   Capellmeister. The Court was Calvinist, so there was no church music at Cöthen; however, Bach would
   compose much instrumental music, some of which was destined to be used in later compositions
   including Cantata Sinfonias. The Sinfonia from Cantata 29, for example, is derived from the Partita
   for Solo Violin, BWV 1006; the two Sinfonias from Cantata 35, opening Part 1 and Part 2 of this
   lengthy cantata, are both presumed to derive from a lost Violin Concerto, which Bach later (1730s?)
   adapted as a Harpsichord Concerto of which only a fragment remains. The Sinfonia from Cantata 52 is
   drawn from the First Brandenburg Concerto, while the Sinfonia from Cantata 174 (Leipzig 1729) is an
   adaptation of the first movement of the third Brandenburg Concerto with the addition of 2 horns and
   3 oboes. The Sinfonias from Cantata 146 and Cantata 156 were both drawn from lost violin concertos,
   later adapted as Harpsichord Concertos in the 1730s (BWV 1052 and 1056 respectively).

   When Bach took over the St.Thomas cantorate in the spring of 1723 as the leading musician of the
   leading cantorate in Protestant Germany, he achieved at long last the opportunity to realize one of
   his artistic aspirations: "the ultimate goal of a regulated church music." His first offering, on
   May 30, 1723, was Cantata 75, closely followed by Cantata 76, of which the Sinfonia to Part 2 of
   this work would later appear as a Trio Sonata for pedal-harpsichord or organ.

   Why Bach should include a Sinfonia in his cantatas is not clear, since it has no religious
   significance, though Sinfonia would certainly not be out of place. An incentive might perhaps be a
   visiting musician of standing – a celebrated oboist for example, might be invited to perform as
   soloist in the Sunday Cantata, with a specially written (or adapted!) Sinfonia featuring a solo oboe
   part. In 1730 an alteration to the organ in the Thomaskirche allowed the Ruckpositiv to be played
   spearately, allowing Bach the opportunity to conduct from the organ. This might have given rise to
   the two "organ showcase" Sinfonias to Cantata 29 and Cantata 146.

   This present assembly of Bach's Cantata Sinfonias brings to the listener not fortunate enough to
   possess the complete cantatas a wealth of instrumental richness which might otherwise never be
   encountered. The variety and freedom of form, and the wealth of instrumentation make for compelling
   listening from start to finish.

   The front cover illustration to our booklet shows "singers and instrumentalists gathered around a
   harpsichord during a cantata rehearsal"; though dated 1775, the scene would not have changed in the
   forty or so years since Bach's days at Leipzig. Bach's rehearsals would have taken place in the
   large room on the second floor of the Thomas School building which adjoined the Thomas Church as was
   home to the St Thomas School and Choir – the Thomanerchor.

***** Pizzicati in aria of [[BWV 95]].5 Aria Tenore "Ach schlage doch bald, selge Stunde"

Comment from bach-cantatas.com: http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Guide/BWV95-Guide.htm

Mvt. 5: The only true aria (the 3rd mvt. comes close to being one) in this cantata is mvt. 5 (tenor)
which is framed on either side by a secco recitative by the tenor before the aria and by the bass
after it. This mvt. has the only non-chorale text of the entire cantata. In negating the world, it
expresses an utterly ecstatic wish for death. "Schlage doch bald den allerletzten Glockenschlag"
("Ring the final bell (death knell) as soon as possible.") Schweitzer noted: "We often hear the
pealing of the funeral bells in Bach's music. It does not even need any definite word to call up a
musical picture of this kind; the mere mention of death and the end of things is enough. Sometimes
it is only bells sounding vaguely from afar, that we hear in the pizzicati of the strings. In this
mvt. we hear the pealing of bells also in the bc in the repeated two-note figure with rests in
between them." The Suzuki liner notes call this mvt. "a symphony of bells. The 1st violins are in
semiquavers, the 2nds and violas in quavers and the continuo in crotchets, all pizzicato, imitating
the sound of diverse sizes of bells. On top of this the oboes d'amore develop a happy duo." Here are
the special effects and symbols ascribed to the various elements of this aria:

1) the oboi d'amore - a lullaby-style melody with an after-effect echo; imitation of the swinging
   death bells
2) the pizzicati of the strings - Schweitzer: "give a wonderful effect of distant bells."

   On the word "längst" ("for the longest time") Bach has the tenor hold a long high note on a G#.

From bach-cantatas.com http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV61-D2.htm

Peter Smaill wrote (March 27, 2005):

The focus in the prior discussions of this fine Cantata has been the discography so as before my
thoughts dwell on the imagery.

Both Robertson and Whittaker, indeed many contributors too, are particularly struck by the movement
whose form is least analysed in the cantatas-the recitative; in this case BWV61/4, "Siehe, siehe,
ich stehe vor der Tur und klopfe an".

The image of Christ knocking on the door, symbolising His call to the the individual soul, is from
Revelations 3/20, and as so often when Bach depicts a mystical theme the result is highly
affecting. But is there, to the musicologist, any particular quality in Bach's general use of
pizzicato which distinguishes his use of the technique? My sources are silent on the point even
though these two examples alone are of high musical quality.

In this instance the pizzicato depicts the striking act; whereas the pizzicato in BWV 95/ 5, uses
pizzicato in the context of death, "Only call soon (thou most beloved of holy bells)" the musical
language is in both cases indicative of a striking action. The graphical analogy for BWV 61/4 must
be Holman Hunt's famous Pre-Raphaelite painting, "The Light of the World" (1851), in Keble College,
Oxford; which explicitly illustrates exactly the same passage in Revelations.

***** [[BWV 127]] Woodwind + strings pizzicato: Death / Bells
****** From http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV127-D.htm

 Mvt. 3. Aria for Soprano "The woodwinds and the strings, pizzicato illustrate the sadness of this
 death-scene with a tear-motif. The quiet serenity of he passing is marked by the plucked strings and
 by staccato quavers of the flutes and oboes, all in imitation of tolling bells. The text mentions
 that she is unafraid, although the melody seems to indicate the reverse. It is a superlative aria,
 nevertheless, for the realistic imagery and personal emotion."

****** From http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/notes_cantata/n_bwv127.htm

 The tenor recitative and soprano aria describe a sinner’s last moments on earth. The tenor with
 great horror and vividness enumerates the last terror, the chilling sweat of death, the stiff
 limbs. He begs for repose. That moment of repose is the soprano aria. Two recorders play little
 repeated bell tones over a pizzicato bass. An oboe sings a melody of heartbreaking sadness and
 repose. The child soprano sings of the soul resting in Jesus’ hands, when earth covers the body. The
 B section begs for the death bells to call one soon. At this point all of the upper strings join in
 with the continuo pizzicatos. At the end of the line of text on the word “unerschrocken” the
 pizzicatos stop and the oboe like a tiny “last trumpet” plays a flourish up to high Bb announcing
 the awaking of Jesus. The gesture is so amazingly dramatic that one feels Bach has to undercut it by
 giving the aria a full da capo. A drama so profound needs distance from this kind of realism.

***** [[BWV 8]] pizzicato death
****** From emmanuel music: http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/notes_cantata/n_bwv008.htm

 The bell tones continue in the bass of the tenor aria #2. Not only do the instruments remain
 pizzicato, but also the rhythmic pattern is set up in the first bar and repeated in virtually every
 bar throughout the piece. The oboe and the tenor weave an arching and very detailed duet over this
 bass. The whole mood is of a mildly melancholy yearning. The accompanied alto recitative brings
 forth a bit of the terror of death, but it is just a transition to the amazingly jolly bass aria
 with flute and strings. Like the opening chorus this aria is in 12/8 time, but the calm flowing
 character of the opening has been replaced by a real jig tempo. The aria is in a very sophisticated
 da capo form. One should notice how the melodic contour of the last line of the A section is
 completed and answered by the opening of the B section.

     <2010-10-16 Sat 19:01>
     [[BWV 121]] : According to Eric Chafe (2000: 140), the gregorian chant model of the chorale melody for BWV
     121, "[...] whether accidental or not, the melody of "A solis ortus cardine" can be con-
     sidered to mirror the idea of a new beginning such as that of the rising sun: its
     melody shifts up a tone from its D Dorian beginning to an ending in E Phrygian. In
     the four-phrase Gregorian melody both the first and the last phrase begin on d and
     end on e, while the second and third close on b and a, respectively. And the chorale
     version follows the same basic pattern, sticking close to the outline of the Gregorian
     melody but simplifying its contours and altering the cadential tone of the second
     phrase from b to c'. ".

     NB: The latin origin of the chorale melody is explained by Chafe (2000: 139) as follows: "Luther's
     chorale "Christum wir sollen loben schon" had ancient roots, in that not only does the poem
     paraphrase the first seven strophes of the medieval hymn "A solis ortus cardine," written by Caelius
     Sedulius in the fifth century, but also the melody derives from the Gregorian melody associated with
     the Latin hymn. "

    Parodies in Bach’s Vocal Works
    Part 1

    BWV 52 and the Brandenburgs / Brandenburg / The Cantata - Brandenburg Concertos Connection / Parodies

    Thomas Braatz wrote (November 20, 2001):
    After making the discovery of the 'holiness' theme present in the 1st mvt. of the 1st BB courtesy of Eric Chafe last night, I happened to hear the 2nd Brandenburg on WFMT early this morning. Still half dozing off, I began to recognize the theme that Chafe was talking about in the 1st mvt. of the 1st BB. My first thought was "This is too easy. We're talking about 'walking up and down a major chord with a tag ending.' Certainly this is the most basic element in music and will be ever-present, particularly in Baroque music." My second thought was "Bach being the recognized master could have chosen any other type of motif to show off his skill, had he wanted to do this. Why this simple, basic motif? Could it also serve as a unifying element in all six of the BB's?"

    The answer is yes.

    What this could also mean is that Bach could and would have used all the 1st mvts. of the BB's in church. It is very possible then that he may have recycled all of them as introductory sinfonias in the cantatas. We simply do not have all the cantatas that he composed.

    This is what I found:

    1st BB BWV 1046

    This has the motif in its purest form in the opening horn signal of the 1st mvt. Bach is announcing not only the theme of the 1st mvt. of the 1st BB, but also states what will become the unifying element for all 6 BB's! With Bach's skill and ability in embellishing a theme, he will not stick to a simple, repeated device that is always easily recognized. Consider how Bach is able to transform the melodic line of a chorale!

    2nd BB BWV 1047

    The motif first appears in the bc in mvt. 1 and is repeated there a number of times: ms. 6-7, 26-27, 37-38, 116-117 The trumpet gets the motif without the tag (a leap of a fifth at the end) in ms. 47, 81. You can hear a slightly modified version of the motif in ms. 1, 2.

    3rd BB BWV 1048

    The violas at the beginning of the 1st mvt. have the pattern but omit the upper octave note in ms. 1, 104. This pattern is repeated by other groupings of strings. This modified motif seems almost like a carry-over of the slightly modified trumpet fanfare in the 2nd BB.

    When the 3 violins enter with the motif in ms. 21, Bach marks only these instruments with a 'forte,' thus drawing attention to it. Why would he have to do this, other than for the reason that he wants to mark the motif and not have it get lost in the overall orchestral sound. It appears again at ms. 34, 102.

    The 1st violin in ms. 77,78 uses a further modification of the motif as a fugal subject.

    The 3rd mvt. uses only the beginning 3-note fragment of the theme.

    4th BB BWV 1049

    The 2nd recorder immediately begins with the motif at the beginning of the 1st mvt., this time the arpeggiation begins on the 3rd rather than the base of the triad and the tag, instead of having a leap of a 5th, now is a 6th.

    5th BB BWV 1050

    In mvt. 1 the violins have a modified version of this motif in ms. 1, 19, 219 - 220. The cellos have it in ms. 35, 36. The harpsichord has it in the left hand in ms. 81, 83, 85, 87, 89 with the final interval dropping down rather than jumping up.

    6th BB BWV 1051

    In the 1st mvt. the violas da braccio I,II in ms. 1 after coming down the embellished chord give the most highly embellished version of the motif in ms. 2, 3, also ms. 47, 48 and 115-117.

    The 3rd mvt. contains short fragments of the motif.

    Henny van der Groep wrote (November 24, 2001):
    Was it you Tom Braatz who wrote about that marvellous discovery in the Brandenburgs concerto. I liked it very much .I'm so silly to lose it and I wanted to listen to your discoveries. Is there any possibility where to find it again?

    I'm sorry for the trouble I cause.

    Thomas Braatz wrote (November 24, 2001):
    [To Henny van der Groep] The credit for the main part of this discovery goes to Eric Chafe. All that I did was to extend this connection to the other Brandenburg Concertos. If Aryeh Oron will allow me to present this material reworked (in a simplified version) with examples from the scores of the cantatas (Chafe's examples) and the evidence that I found in the Brandenburg Concertos, I think everything will be much easier to understand because the musical examples can then be viewed and studied. One great drawback is that this material can not be presented directly here. Aryeh will have to agree to accept all the work that is necessary in setting this up on his site. I also need some time to finish my computer setup (I am presently in the midst of some major changes.)

    Thank you for asking. This type of feedback is what I needed to encourage me elaborate a project that others will want to view.

    Don't worry too much about losing anything on this site - Aryeh Oron usually catches everything and puts it on his site.

    Aryeh Oron wrote (November 24, 2001):

    Do I allow? Do I agree? Of course!

    < Don't worry too much about losing anything on this site - Aryeh Oron usually catches everything and puts it on his site. >
    The discussions about Cantata BWV 52, including the connection between the Brandenburg Concertos and the Cantatas, appear in the following page of the Bach Cantatas Website: http://www.bach-cantatas.com/BWV52-D.htm

    Henny van der Groep wrote (November 24, 2001):
    [To Thomas Braatz] You're too modest. I've listened to all movements of B.B's and it's there. I'm very excited about it. Such a discovery! Thanks for sharing. Bruckner, who was a very religious man often used the horns to express himself. I believe he wanted symbolize holiness too.

    < 1st BB BWV 1046
    This has the motif in its purest form in the opening horn signal of the 1st mvt. Bach is announcing not only the theme of the 1st mvt. of the 1st BB, but also states what will become the unifying element for all 6 BB's! >
    It's a beautiful "read thread" and it strangely reminded me of a conversation I had about Beethoven's Piano Sonata op.10 no 1. In the first movement were you find in the very rhythmical first theme group a very short germ of two notes descending (a second) which you'll find back through his sonata and has a very superior function. It reminds me also of Liszt with his H moll sonata with it's germs. Bach is so very modern and timeless I'll never get tired of his music! New discoveries all the time, just great. Sorry for rambling. (thanks Aryeh!)

    Dick Wursten wrote (November 24, 2001):
    I'm very sorry, but all this has too much of: 'he who will seek, will find' (whatever he seeks). It asks for a parody, but I'm not qualified to write it, so I just second Thomas FIRST thought:
    < "This is too easy. We're talking about 'walking up and down a major chord with a tag ending.' Certainly this is the most basic element in music and will be ever-present,particularly in Baroque music." >

    Henny van der Groep wrote (November 25, 2001):
    Below you'll find an summary of Bach's Parodies, some of you will know. Composed a long time before I even knew about the book from Neumann. It's time to change a few thing and of course remarks are welcome. Aryeh perhaps you will make an Url to the Parodies so everybody has a totally quick view of all combinations. It's may be usefull.

    Excuse me about my ignorance but I was not able to follow; what is the discovery about Brandenburg Concertos?

    Maria Dimaki [Copenhagen, Denmark] wrote (November 12, 2002):
    Thanks to the new websites with all the Bach cantatas, for which I'm grateful, I have managed for the first time to hear the music I was longing to hear for such long time. I have so far managed to listen to the first 65 cantatas and I still have a long way to go, but for now I have a question:

    At least in the first few cantatas I identified several parts of the Mass in B minor (BWV 232): the Agnus Dei, the Crucifixus and more I don't quite remember right now. Also, I'm pretty certain I heard parts ressembling music I had heard in St. John Passion (BWV 245) and perhaps also the Christmas Oratorio. How common is this recycling in Bach's works? I know for example that most of the chorales in the passions, oratorios and in the cantatas are the same (melody) but I was a bit surprised when I heard some arias and choral parts being the same.

    [To Maria Dimaki] Since everyone is possibly thinking that they'll let someone else field this one, I guess I'll be the someone else

    First off, the fact that you found the similarities among all those works shows a commendable melodic sense, not to mention memory!

    So here's the deal:

    The process of borrowing, which is actually know as parodying, was more common in the Baroque era than was the Italian style (of music-has nothing to do with parodying) during the same time.

    While this may not be a clear point of comparison, my point is that many great composers did it back then. (Except for Vivaldi-I think-whose style from one work to another is so similar that he is jokingly called the "Xerox machine"-all his works sound very similar and distinctive, but I'm not sure as to the extent of his parodying practice).

    Anyway, by the 18th century this practice had gotten so far out of hand (to our standards) that composers actually started stealing from other composers! (As you've referred to, use of chorales does not count as parodying, but Bach transcribed other people's concertos onto organ, named the original composer in the title, and for some odd reason these transcriptions are in the BWV catalogue! who's the parodier in this case?)

    Of course, parodying was mostly taken from the composer's past work, as is very evident in Bach and Handel. For a small example, 2/3 of Händel's Rinaldo is parodied, as are almost all of Bach's Misse Brevis (taken from Sacred Cantatas), and a bundle from the Christmas Oratorio is from cantatas as well.

    Listen to Cantata BWV 191 - the only Latin cantata, and compare with the Mass in B min.

    Enjoy!

    ps. this survey is not intended in any way to degrade anyone's opinion of the great Baroque masters-IMO the greatest era in musical history-but to highlight another aspect of their genius-that of resourcefullness.

    [To Matthew Neugebauer] Thanks, Matthew - well done.

    Just add to that the thought that in those days, they had no fear of an audience's ability to run out, purchase a CD and run home and listen to a work many times over, as we do! So taking a particularly well-written element or entire movement and recycling it would run small risk of offending a paying audience (even if they were paying with offerings).

    Boyd Pehrson wrote (November 14, 2002):
    [To Maria Dimaki & Matthew Neugebauer] Maria, I like your question. I was waiting for someone other than me to jump in and answer this time. I can add to Matthew's great comments regarding Bach's 'resourcefulness' as Matthew so aptly put it.

    Regarding what Bach re-used for what composition - a great book was published by Allen & Unwin in 1967 titled "Bach the Borrower". Author Norman Carrell details the works of Bach that contain "borrowed" material. That would be Bach's own material re-used in various compositions - instrumental and vocal, and outside materials- secular and sacred. Regarding the Cantatas alone, Carrell documents almost 200 borrowings from other of Bach's own works as well as borrowings from about 200 German hymns. Along with great resourcefulness, Bach had a practical consideration in composing Church music, in that the congregation would know well the hymns that were used for Cantata materials- whether in hymn tune or hymn text. (Carrell's book should be available at most good University Libraries. I highly recommend borrowing a copy! :-)

    Spitta said regarding Bach's borrowing from secular works for his church Cantatas:
    " In the face of the inexhaustible inventive wealth, and the profound sense of artistic responsibility, testified in Bach's works, no one would dare assert that such transfers were made for mere convenience sake, or for lack of time. They were made with a perfect feeling that the compositions in question would not be seen in their right place till they were set for Church use."

    Bach sanctified his favourite music for use in the church. Also, I believe Bach knew his target audience well, and profoundly understood what would stir them in their faith regarding the service of Word and Sacrament and the traditions of German Lutheranism, as his place was to achieve a translation of the service- sacrament and sermon- into a pure musical expression. Such a task cannot be undertaken with only new expressions. The value of familiar musical material and hymns is very important to the task of the Church Cantor. These previous expressions of faith in music connected the listener to deep experiences of spirituality they could readily re-connect to in Bach's new Church Cantatas. We cannot know the depth of meaning these may have had to Bach's original listeners who brought significant personal history and emotions listening to their favourite hymns. Bach certainly knew which hymns- and secular music would be most effective in his own culture. Thus the value and insight of Bach's "borrowing" magnifies his genius. The astounding thing is that today the background and atmosphere of those borrowed elements still works to evoke deep emotions in a variety of Cantata, Oratorio, Motet and Mass contexts for us over 250 years later.

    Dear Matthew, Douglas, Boyd and all,

    Thank you all for your replies to my questions. I will take your advice and both listen to cantata 191 and try and locate and "borrow" that book on Bach.

    As a child learning the piano I was always against any attempt of my teacher to make me play Bach (of course I had to) and she kept telling me that when I grew older I would beg her to let me play Bach. She was right. Now I can't stop listening to his works, whether choral or instrumental.

    Thank you all again,


    What’s parodying?

    Juozas Rimas wrote (December 9, 2002):
    what exactly was meant by "parodying" in Baroque? It wasn't understood in the today's sense of farcical or satirical immitation, was it?

    They say most of the Xmas Oratorio (BWV 248) is parodied from other cantatas. I compared a few examples and the parody seemed to be simply changes in the text and perhaps some changes in the music.

    Anyway, "Bereite dich, Zion" from Xmas Oratorio doesn't sound more comical than its source in the BWV 213 (Lasst uns sorgen, lasst uns wachen).

    Thomas Braatz wrote (December 10, 2002):
    [To Juozas Rimas] An excellent article by Daniel Melamed in the Oxford Composer Companions [Boyd] gives an explanation which makes clear that 'parody' when used in discussing Bach's works is not unique to Bach's works (Händel didthis as well), but goes back to the 16th century where there were such things as a 'parody mass' based on musical material found elsewhere and incorporated into the mass.

    Nowhere in the use of this special, musicological term is there even a hint of the comical or farcical element which is the primary meaning in the English language. Forget all about this meaning when trying to understand this term as used in the literature about Bach.

    As Melamed correctly points out: Bach usually parodied his own works in the same category either only sacred or only secular (a mvt. from an earlier cantata might be reworked as a mvt. of a later cantata with a different text - Bach might have had to change the text that was tied to a specific Sunday of the church year to a different text to fit a different Sunday -- it is not always known who did this, Bach or some other unknown librettist); but as a general rule Bach would only move previous secular cantata mvts (the music) into the sacred category (with a new sacred text) and not vice versa. There is no such example that demonstrates the reverse mvt. from sacred to secular. Melamed comments on this in greater detail.

    Personally, Bach's parody of a secular cantata that ended up as key mvts. of the Easter Oratorio makes the greatest impression on me. It is fascinating to follow the transformation of the details here and to determine with what great economy Bach was able to accomplish this. The music remains almost completely unchanged but the text moves from sheep grazing among the grasses and falling asleep to an observer looking in upon Christ's grave and finding only a 'Schweißtuch' [a sweat cloth - this was discussed in detail on this site some time ago.] For many years I had heard the Easter Oratorio without ever knowing about the parody. This was a real 'eye-opener.'

    Many mvts. of the B minor Mass (BWV 232) are also parodies of other earlier sacred cantata mvts.

    Matthew Neugebauer wrote (December 10, 2002):
    [To Thomas Braatz] Also, weren't all the Lutheran Missae Brevis complete parodies from cantatas?

    SJ GH wrote (December 10, 2002):
    [To Thomas Braatz] The term 'parodying,' in this case is probably carried over from the Renaissance. A work that is parodied (particularly a mass) is composed around a segment (usually all voices) from another work. Parody masses were common with Renaissance composers who took segments of their own (or others') motets and used them as the basis for the entire mass. If only one line is used for the basis of the mass (or cantata, in this case) the work would be 'paraphrased' rather than 'parodied.'

    I hope this sheds a little light.

    Santu de Silva wrote (December 12, 2002):
    There's an interesting instance of parody, i believe, in Charpentier's Mass for Chriswtmas Eve (for the midnight mass, specifically). It consists of the mass, all movements sung to tunes taken from carols. It's really beautiful and Christmassy.


    ‘Instrumental’ Bach

    Continue of discussion from HIP - Part 7 [General Topics]

    Marcus wrote (January 26, 2003):
    [To Matthew Neugebauer] I think we may be over-estimating the influence of instruments - or the performing medium - on Bach's compositions.

    In my experience with Bach's music I've noticed that he doesn't compose in any specific instrumental idioms. Notice how many transcriptions exists in his just chamber/instrumental oeuvre, from the violin concertos ported-over to the harpsichord conc...or vice-versa, the Flute Trio Sonata/Viola-da-Gamba Sonata #1.

    Or how about the well known secular->sacred parody in his cantatas like the opening of the Violin Partita #3 played on the organ to open Cantata BWV 29, and the arrangement of the Orchestral Suite #4 Ouverture with voices to Cantata BWV 110. All this is evidence of Bach's lack of creativity and laziness right?

    In our "modern" time, Andres Segovia plays the Solo Violin Partitas on the as if Bach specifically wrote them for guitar, and recordings of other works transcribed to instruments of all sorts can be found.

    There is a quote, whose source I have since forgotten, that neatly summarizes: "Bach composed not on the premise that music is made for instruments; but that instruments are made for music."

    If that is the case, then the question of how Bach would write given today's instruments is inconsequential.

    The difficulty of the brass parts or the vocal lines in his cantatas were not the result of a hope that future more "improved" players and instruments could execute them, it is just more evidence that he seldom restricted his compositions to any particular instrumental idiom. Why can't florid running-sixteenths scalar woodwind passages be played on a trumpet instead or sung by a choir? We certainly shouldn't assume Bach's musicians were incapable of executing his music to the same quality as their modern counterparts.

    Counter-examples or flames welcomed! :)

    Matthew Neugebauer wrote (January 26, 2003):
    < All this is evidence of Bach's lack of creativity and laziness right? >
    I'm hoping this is a rhetorical question, but in this case it requires the speaker to answer it. However, without putting any judgement on Marcus, I'll answer it: the answer is the exact opposite-it's a pure example of his creativity. We must also remember that 150 yrs before his time, instruments were rarely specified-if at all-save for the disctinction that the part was in fact for instruments and not for voice (although voice parts were often doubled or replaced by instruments).

    Back to Bach:

    In the booklet accompanying the sampler to the Bach 2000 cpte works, there is a line that sums it up (unfortunately, the author is not identified): "Bach was a genius, not in a Romantic sense, but as a genius of industriousness."

    As well, we know that back then parodying was as common as wearing wigs, and Bach really made the practice an art form in itself.

    Thomas Braatz wrote (January 26, 2003):
    [To Marcus] There is a seeming contradiction in all of this. It has long been noted that Bach expected his vocalists to sing music which appears to be more 'instrumental' in nature than 'vocal.' My thought on this is that it facilitated writing music with a higher unity particularly where instruments and voices are 'competing' against each other as in many of the cantatas. By making the voices sing these more instrumental parts, Bach achieved a greater uniformity, a greater coherence than could exist if the vocal parts were forced to sing only in the old, archaic style that existed in the pre-Bach period. This similarity achieved between instrumental and vocal writing facilitated, in particular, the use of more complicated fugal compositions involving awkward jumps and long melismatic passages where finding a place to breathe, to be sure, becomes a serious problem, particularly in the case of an aria. But now Bach could conceive a grand fugue unfettered by the conventions of vocal (choral as well) writing. This is the advantage that he gained by asking more of his vocalists.

    On the other hand, Bach did write characteristically for instruments. This was one of the main characteristics of the Baroque as opposed to the Renaissance style of writing for groups of instruments, and Bach truly excelled in this category. Consider some of the instrumental sinfonia in the cantatas where a solo oboe holds sway! Or consider also Bach's use of recorders! Could these parts be played by a violin, flute, or comparable instruments and still sound like they did in their original conception? I personally hear quite a difference. This does not mean that Bach would reject the notion of replacing one instrument type with another. On the contrary, there is sufficient evidence in the instrumentation of the cantatas, that Bach would make such a change 'on the drop of a hat' if he did not have a good instrumentalist in the original category of instrument available. Perhaps Bach did both: 1) he composed specifically and characteristically for an instrument (and perhaps even with the individual instrumentalist in mind); b2) he also acknowledged practical decisions which made substitutions mandatory when the circumstances dictated such a change. (Whether this pained him to do this in some instances, we will never really know.) It does seem, however, from the examples that you cited, that Bach recognized, or even built into his compositions a universality that would allow for this music to be appreciated in many different ways. His own transcriptions of music (his own and that of others) bear witness to this fact.

    One of the major questions is whether anyone can hear the difference between the characteristic writing for oboes, recorders, trombae, etc. and the same parts when played by other instruments such as violins, transverse flutes, or clarinets. The music is still universally good, but is it really what was originally intended? When Bach transcribes a composition from one form with other instruments in mind to one where the harpsichord takes on a solo role, listen to the slow mvts. where the right hand has long notes to play (usually accommodated by playing long trills.) It is quite easy to imagine a number of other instruments that might be able to breathe more life into this singing melody than a harpsichord or piano would, and yet we know that Bach performed it just this way (because the music was great nevertheless.) I find this somewhat similar to playing Beethoven's symphonies in a piano reduction. What great music to actually be playing by oneself! What discoveries are to be made here - even how ingeniously the transcriber was able to reduce an entire orchestra into 2 or 4 hands! But is this really the same as hearing these symphonies with the instruments that Beethoven intended? I don't think so. Despite the sameness (same composition) there is a noticeable difference; and yet, if the piano reduction were the only way to get to know and hear this music (let's assume the original score and parts had been irretrievably lost) I would jump at the chance to hear this great music in a somewhat less than optimal form. But there is also good reason to attempt to ascertain what Bach's original intentions were, as far as this is humanly possible, because he did compose characteristically for specific instruments. Hearing, for example, the oboe solos in the Bach cantatas as Bach intended them is just one step, one notch higher in achieving musical bliss for a listener than hearing a transcription of these for other instruments that are used as a replacement.

    Marcus wrote (January 27, 2003):
    [To Matthew Neugebauer] Yes, Matthew, I completely agree with your views on Bach's use of parody in his works.

    My apologies for being too "cheeky" when I wrote that rhetorical question that resulted in this misunderstanding. I certainly don't believe there is any evidence of Bach's laziness or artistic mediocrity - on the contrary!

    I'll try to be more direct in the future because even an absurd back-handed comment can be easily mis-interpreted on the Internet! Sorry. :)

    Marcus wrote (January 27, 2003):
    [To Thomas Braatz] Thanks very much for your reply - a lot to think about.

    I too have often heard criticism of Bach's vocal writing being too "instrumental" and difficult to sing, but certainly he didn't do it out of spite for his singers or hardly as a result of compositional inadequacies! I think your explanation is right on target - "it facilitated writing music with a higher unity...unfettered by the conventions of vocal/choral writing." I believe your statement can also be applied to other non-vocal works of Bach.

    On the subject of Bach writing characteristically for instruments, I concede it almost impossible to make such a generalization of all his works. I agree that Bach's use of solo oboe or paired recorders in his cantatas argues that he did write very specifically with these instrements in mind to achieve a particular "affekt" or tone-color. I can't imagine the opening of Cantata 106 without a pair of recorders - they so perfectly fit the music and set the mood, not to mention the symbolism of flutes in funerals of that time! Or the scoring of obbligato-organ, strings, without bass-continuo in Cantata BWV 170 mvt 3 that creates what Bach commented as "an infernal whining and drawling" (sorry no source attributed to that quote other than it being used in the Teldec Cantata liner notes).

    I don't have the exact quote, but I remember Albert Schweitzer criticizing Bach's own transcription of his famous Double Violin Concerto in D-minor into the version for two harpsichords. In particular he felt the lyrical slow-movement was completely ruined, "an egregious mistake that only Bach can answer for" (paraphrasing). Personally I think the concerto works just as well with either instrument - I may be a bit biased towards claviers since I play them. :-)

    Despite the examples above, I still think his music, in general, is equally effective in multiple instrument mediums. This is one of the unique qualities of Bach's compositional creativity that sets him apart from all other composers. Would transcribing Beethoven's "Emperor" Piano Conc. no 5 from piano to woodwind be as effective as transcribing any one of Bach's Clavier Concertos to the same? I think Beethoven's music would suffer much more being out of it's original element.

    If given an -equal- choice, I also prefer to hear music performed as close to its original medium/environment as possible. But sometimes in pursuit of that goal, not everyone agrees on the right direction, for example, your criticism of the Harnoncourt cantata performances. We'll have to disagree there...I enjoy his interpretations! :-)

    So what was the point of parodying? If a part of a concerto is used as a sinfonia in cantata, and the rest of the cantata is based on such a sinfonia, the point is clear - to write a cantata which is at least loosely based on the theme of an already written work.

    But was this the case in all the cantatas where parody is used? Are cantatas always based on their respective sinfonias, originating from concerto movements?

    You can say "time saving for more important things" instead of laziness but I wouldn't avoid this. What would be wrong with this - I doubt JSB had enough time for anything whenever he wanted.

    P.S. Parodying, whatever its point was, is a blessing because we likely have the splendid sinfonia of BWV 42 thanks to parodying.

    Well from what I've read from books and from this board, a unique feature of Bach's parody process is that he always ported music from secular -> sacred, never the other way. Also, I'm not aware of a single example of a cantata based entirely on a complete concerto. Bach seems to use only one or two movements per cantata. The following examples come to mind.

    Clavier Concerto Emaj -> BWV 169, BWV 49
    Clavier Concerto Dmin -> BWV 146, BWV 188
    Clavier Conc Fmin mvtII -> BWV 156

    Yes, perhaps the best conclusion from this was that Bach was very practical with the fruit of his labors, especially in light of the enormous non-daily demands of his office. And subsequently we get to enjoy a couple of movements of a concerto in BWV 42 that would otherwise be lost forever.

    Unfortunately despite the loss of over 2 complete Cantata cycles and other sacred works, I suspect the dissolution of his secular instrumental output is many times worse - hinted at in his estate inventory.

    I could only find one exception to this rule (BWV Anh. 18 -> BWV Anh. 12; music lost in both cases). I find that even though the sacred parodies are not always inferior, the secular originals are sometimes more interesting. IMO BWV 30a has a text considerably better than BWV 30, and BWV 214 has no shortage of good arias.

    Actually, the keyboard concertos were written later than the cantatas, but in the first two cases there were probably even earlier instrumental concertos.

    There are two things I do not understand about the attempt to find 'original' solo instruments: the advocacy of the viola d'amore, and Rifkin's equation of the sinfonia to cantata BWV 156 with the second movement of the D minor oboe concerto.

    Regarding the latter:

    Rifkin first made this connection in the BJ 1978, pp. 140-147, in the article, "Ein langsamer Konzertsatz Johann Sebastian Bachs." This subject has since been revisited by B. Haynes in his article, "Johann Sebastian Bachs Oboenkonzerte," in the BJ 1992, pp. 23-43. The NBA KB I/6 published in 1996 finds this connection to be 'plausible.' The problem here is the fact that none of the numerous sources is original. The existence of the earliest copy is documented for the 1st time in 1832. The paper for this copy can be traced back to the 18th century and was still being produced in 1761. There is also the possibility that the copyist (undetermined) was using up old paper stock, a possibility that would even push this date beyond 1761. From the standpoint of direct evidence, everything here seems to be 'up for grabs.' Anything else is based on stylistic considerations and the fact that the printed text for this cantata has been located.

    I don't know the context of these statements, but I doubt that the reason for parodying was lack of industry. i think it was the opposite.

    Bach put a lot of effort into his compositions, and he may have felt that (in an age in which recordings obviously did not exist) it was impossible to get the full impact of a contrapuntal work at one hearing. Today, after having heard bach for years, some of us could, perhaps, apprehend the entire power of one of his works even hearing it for the first time. But back then, the total amount of hours of music each person had would probably have been a small fraction of what we have today. (This is all speculation, but I believe it is reasonable.) Is is necessary to learn to listen to Bach? I believe so. is it possible his audiences were still learning to listen to his cantatas? On a diet of one a week, I would say, yes.

    Consider that he lavished all his concerti initially on the court at Anhalt-Cöthen. I can easily imagine that he would have wanted to bring those to his later audiences. (What are the chances that the members of his parish had already heard his concertos?) it is a measure of how much he invested in the concerti (and in their re-working) that he did re-work them.

    P.S. And so what if he really was lazy, and recycled his concerti not because he loved them, but because he hated writing cantatas? (A preposterous thought, I think!) Industry is overrated. Industry is the last refuge of the talentless :P

    Unfortunately, I'm not aware of a 100% complete inventory of Bach's musical output that was made during his lifetime, so ultimately what percentage has survived to us, I think, is an educated guess.

    The closest thing we have (besides the BWV and NBA catalogs of course) is in Bach's obituary notice written by CPE Bach and JF Agricola, which includes a catalog of all the published and unpublished works of the late Bach. (you can find a copy of the obituary in English in the indispensable "The Bach Reader" by Hans T. David and Arthur Mendel). The five cantata cycles are mentioned as well as the sonatas/partitas/suites for clavier/violin/cello, but what is particularly enticing is the last entry: "16. Endlich eine Menge andere Instrumentalsachen, von allerley Art, und fur allerley Instrumente" "16. Finally, a mass of other instrumental pieces of all kinds and for all kinds of instruments"

    I suggest reading an essay titled "Bach's Leipzig Chamber Music" #17 in a compendium titled "Bach: Essays on His Life and Music" by Christoph Wolff. In the essay, Wolff suggests that despite the small number of chamber works of Bach that have been preserved, there is evidence a much larger repertoire existed at his death, whose survival was directly influenced by the his sons' inheritance of the music. The bulk of the vocal works went to the elders WF and CPE, while the chamber works primarily went to the younger JCF and JC. "The material inherited by the younger sons has, with few exception, not survived."

    Wolff then investigates an interesting hypothesis that the majority Bach's chamber/instrumental works (BWV 1014-1079) may have originated during his Leipzig tenure (1724-1750) rather than in Cöthen (1717-1723) as commonly assumed. Wolff shows that most of the extant sources of the instrumental works date to Leipzig, and the only work that has a source in Cöthen are the Brandenburg Concertos. While this does not rule out that the surviving material are copies of compositions much earlier in his life, it seriously question old notions that automatically relegate the secular instrumental works to the Cöthen period.

    Maybe Bach didn't do much composing in Cöthen and focused instead onperforming??!! :-) (Hard to believe though) More believable to me is that much of his instrumental works were lost after his younger sons inherited it. :-(

    Marcus wrote (January 29, 2003):
    [To Alex Riedlmayer] Yes! Thank you for pointing that out. I forgot to consider this case. And if we believe Bach only parodied from secular->sacred (your one example aside) then this suggests an even earlier composition date for the music.


    Parody

    Peter Bloemendaal wrote (July 22, 2003):
    Since the renaissance the word “parody” has had different meanings. Over the last two centuries it acquired a pejorative sound. Today, in my COD, there appear only two explanations for the noun (there is also the transitive verb, derived from the noun), both of them negative:

    “composition in which an author’s characteristics are ridiculed by imitation”

    “feeble imitation, travesty”

    We all know that in Bach’s time the word had a neutral meaning, something like “borrowing”. In order to widen our horizons or refresh our memories, I hereby copy Professor Daniel R. Melamed’s article from the “Oxford Composer Companions”.

    Parody. A term with at least three possible meanings when applied to music. In Renaissance polyphony it is used to denote the incorporation of existing music (usually from a motet or madrigal) into another work (usually a mass). More generally, the term can denote the imitation or adoption of a musical style for humorous or satirical effect; elements of parody in this sense can be observed in Bach’s Peasant Cantata (BWV 212). However, in the 18th century “parody’ was understood primarily as the fashioning of a new poem on the model of an extant one. It is now taken to mean the retexting of a vocal composition, and more generally the production of a new vocal work based on the music of another piece. The concept is important in Bach studies because so much of the composer’s vocal music appears in more than one guise.

    Bach’s parodies fall into two broad categories.

    The first is the reworking of most or all of a vocal composition into a piece for a new occasion. These parodies clearly began with the production of a parody text based on the structure, diction, rhyme, and metre of the original [as for example BWV 173(a) – PB]. Musically, this kind of parody most often involved revisions to choruses and arias, and the composition of new simple recitatives. Most of the compositions Bach treated this way had been performed only once, including many of the secular cantatas for royalty, nobility, and the university. The parody version was sometimes a work, that could be used every year such as a weekly church cantata or oratorio (e.g. BWV 30 and BWV 36) and sometimes a work for another special occasion (BWV 205a, BWV 207a, and BWV 210a). The most important example of this type is the CHRISTMAS ORATORIO (BWV 248), fashioned largely from three secular cantatas (BWV 213, BWV 214, BWV 215).

    The second broad category of Bach’s parodies consists of works assembled movement by movement from various sources.. almost all are Latin liturgical works, including the four short masses, the Dresden “missa”, and most of the music added to it to form the Mass in B minor (BWV 232). These parodies are largely musical creations, in the sense that existing music is adapted to an existing text, rather than a new text being fitted to existing music. Bach evidently searched out movements from his cantatas whose text and music lent themselves to adaptation for particular sections of the fixed Mass text. He also occasionally parodied works by other composers, for example partly retexting a work of J. C. J.C. Kerll for the Sanctus BWV 241.

    Parodies must often have been executed in close collaboration with a librettist, and parody was apparently a particular skill of the Leipzig poet C.F. Henrici (Picander). Picander wrote the text for the lost memorial service music for Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen derived from his own “St. Matthew Passion” (BWV 244) and from the “Trauer Ode” (BWV 198). He and Bach clearly constructed the new work around the existing music. They may have planned the lost “St. Mark Passion” (BWV 247), thought to have consisted largely of parodies, in the same way. Picander was possibly also the librettist of the “Christmas Oratorio” (BWV 248), whose text was assembled with specific parody models in mind.

    It is often noted that many of Bach’s parodies remain in the realm either of the sacred or of the secular; those that cross over are transformations from secular works to church compositions, never the other way round. It is unclear, though, whether the direction of these transformations reflects Bach’s ideas about sacred versus secular music, or whether it is merely the consequence of his tendency to parody pieces usable only once (most of the secular works fall into this category) as works for recurring occasions (such as liturgical pieces).

    The detection of likely parodies by the close comparison of texts has proved to be one of the most successful tools in the reconstruction of lost works, especially where sources of extant pieces suggest that their surviving text was not the original. There are also some texts that correspond so closely to others with extant music by Bach that they suggest a parody relationship. The search for textual parallels has risks – it can only suggest parody, not prove it – and the method of identifying poetic correspondences has led to occasionally far-fetched claims that Bach set certain texts to music now lost.

    Over the years, the extent and technique of Bach’s parody procedure have come to be well understood, but this understanding has not resolved long-standing questions of why Bach made parodies, and what it means that he did. On one side of this controversial issue is a sense of discomfort with parodies, stemming largely from Romantic and modern aesthetics that place a premium on originality and novelty. (The continued agonizing over Handel’s “borrowing” present a parallel case.) On the other side is the pragmatic view that parody represent Bach’s efficient use of hard-won musical material, and that we should focus on the musical and textual significance of Bach’s particular parody choices rather than on their morality. For the moment, the pendulum has swung to the latter view, but this is the sort of aesthetic that will never be fully resolved.

    [To Peter Bloemendaal] As usual, you are such a good writer. You make learning informative and painless. I remember we talked about parodies before. You mentioned that you were glad Bach transformed works from secular to sacred with different words, and that this doesn't affect your 'religious' fervor. But you do say now that it is unclear what Bach's intentions were religiously when turning secular to sacred. I feel strongly that Bach is very much in Renaissance mode here. He strides the eras of Renaissance and Baroque with great smoothness. No awkwardness here!

    Peter Bloemendaal wrote (July 22, 2003):
    [To Francine Renee Hall] These were not my words, but Daniel Melamed's. I quoted his article without giving my own opinion. I agree with you that Bach was very much a child of his time. Like Melamed said, one can think of different motivations: practicality ( saving time), being not in the right mind or mood (lackof inspiration ), the wish to use a unique beautiful piece of music for more than one occasion, the challenge ("let me see what I can make of this"), the wish to hear the work performed for different voices and instruments, renewed inspiration by one of his former pieces or the work of another composer, maybe on instigation of Anna Magdalena, who can say? Of course, as parody was perfectly accepted at the time, Bach did not have any scruples to turn to it. Still, it is telling that in his cantatas he exclusively exalted a "profane" theme to a spiritual one. I feel that he did not want to "degrade" a sacred theme to a mundane level. And I am happy he felt that way.

    Bradley Lehman wrote (July 22, 2003):
    [To Peter Bloemendaal] Good piece about parody, Peter!

    Re the last paragraph (below), I simply don't understand people who insist that a parody work is automatically of less value than the first use of the material. Parody, and contrafactum, and similar methods of reusing material are useful techniques in the creative process.

    In my business projects outside music, I regularly reuse one client's project into the next client's project, or reach back into any of the past dozen projects, to get components I need for the new one. Then I integrate these with any new portion that is necessary. The new client gets better work this way, a more solid product and produced at less expense (billable time): the components have already been proven in real use. Plus, our staff already know how to support those older components and don't need to be retrained by me, except on the new portions. I can move on from project to project, with a toolkit full of reliable components (some original, others created by my colleagues) that could come up again anywhere. And the later use of a component can also inform improvements back into the first copy of it, as more is learned from wider use: everybody gets a more solid product that way, the maintenance of one system informing another. Once a certain problem has been solved by someone, that solution can be reused instead of solving the same thing again from scratch. Even within an entirely new portion of something, much of the work is simply cloning a small piece that was already tested yesterday and then changing its details...plenty of "busy-work".

    The creation of a project is breaking it down to manageable pieces, and solving each piece, and reintegrating it. This is good business. This same process works in music, too (composition, and practicing a piece for performance): just another craft.

    Deborah Carroll wrote (July 23, 2003):

       Bach transcribing (to or from) his own cantatas

       Alan Melvin wrote (July 12, 2004):
       In the process of listening to (so far) about 150 Bach cantatas, I keep coming across music which I think I've heard before in transcribed form, but I can't trace it.

       The few I've already identified are common knowledge: the Schuebler chorales, the Preludio BWV 1006, Adagio BWV 1056, and the cantata sinfonias based on BWV 1046 and 1048. But these seem to be only the beginning.

       Is there any resource (perhaps a book I can find in the music conservatory library) that can help me assemble a list of these transcriptions?

       P.S. - The latest one I'm curious about is the so-called turtle-dove chorus from BWV 71. I could swear I heard this as an organ solo years ago. Anyone familiar with it?

       [To David Glenn Lebut Jr.] David, I bookmarked the site then looked again and saw that it says BWV 198 as the original and BWV 244 as the parody. There are mentions of the use of two other originals, BWV 106, BWV 161 for the aforementioned parody.

       Maybe I misunderstood your point, I was a tad confused about the Weimar Passion bit until I googled it and lo and behold I was able to read some Joshua Rifkin's notes about the SMP (BWV 244) on the BCW !

       [To Alan Melvin] Two comments: about the Turtledove chorus. When I first heard it, I was baffled. It wasn't Bach's style at all. I heard this 20 years ago, and I don't think I've heard any other work by Bach which might count as a reworking of it. However, I have heard at least one work with a very similar ending. Le Coucou, a harpsichord piece, something like that.

       As for transcriptions and retranscriptions, I've come across a few, but it's the kind of question I couldn't provide chapter and verse quickly.

       What might help is Riemenschneider's 371 harmonised chorales which shows how for example Christus, der uns selig macht appears in 4 separate guises, and a chorale that appears in two separate cantatas may pinpoint links where other movements have also been retranscribed.

       Also, the Weimarer-Passion connection has nothing to do with the Matthaeuspassion, but with the Johannespassion, and particularly the second version of it.

No recordings that I know of. The music is possibly lost. I have seen where the NBA has it (Vol. I/41), but also have heard and read where it is lost. I am working on a reconstruction of it and of all versions of Bach's Passion music.

Actually, what we have as far as the Matthaeuspassion is concerned is the version from 1742 (that one that Richter recorded in 1979). We have only the parts for the 1736 version. We have the text and could easilly reconstruct the movements for the Markuspassion (BWV 247). Also, only two movements are missing (tbe one that replaces Nrs. 13 and 14 and the Sinfonie that replaces Nrs. 33-35) from a complete reconstruction of the 1732 version of the Johannespassion (BWV 245). I have a few ideas of workable movements for the Sinfonie, but would welcome some suggestions for the Arie. As to the Lukaspassion, I also think that this is workable.

< 3. What is latest scholarship on the composer of the St Luke Passion? >
The latest that I know of is that it is still unknown. The best source for current info (outside of the Bach-Jahrbuch and possibly Christoph Wolff's new Bach biography) is the liner notes of the Helbich recording.

< 4. David has mentioned a Weimar Passion. Does the music for this still exist? >
The music and text for this work (BWV deest, BC D 01) is lost. However, Bach used for sure five movements, although I have heard and read of at least seven movements, in other works. The five definites were reused in the 1725 version of the Johannespassion (BWV 245), and two were also reused in other works. The two that were also reused in other works were the opening and closing Choralsaetze: "O Mensch, bewein' dein' Suende gross'" (openining Choralsatz), which was reused (transposed up 1/2 step) in the 1736 and 1742 versions of the Matthäuspassion (BWV 244), and "Christe, du Lamm Gottes," (closing Choralsatz), which Bach also used as the fourth and final movement of "Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn" BWV 23, which he performed for the first time (along with BWV 22) at his trial for the position of Leipzig Thomaskantor. The other three definites were also reused in the 1725 Johannespassion (BWV 245): the Bassarie mit Choral "Himmelreise, Welt erbebe", the Tenora"Zerschmettert mich, ihr Felsen und ihr Hügel", and the Tenorarie "Ach, windet euch nicht so, geplagte Seelen,". The two others are the Choralsatz "Christus, der uns selig macht," BWV 283 and an unspecified movement Bach also used in the Kantate "Ich, armer Mensch, ich Suendenknecht" BWV 55.

This work Bach wrote in Weimar and performed it on Good Friday 1717 in Gotha at the request of the the court there in the stead of the Kapellmeister Christian Friedrich Witt (who was at the time on his deathbed).

< 5. What is the connection between Bach and the St Mark Passion (BWV 247) originally attributed to Reinhard Keiser and now attributed to Bruhns? >
Bach wrote three Passionspasticcios on this work during his lifetime. The first (BWV deest (BC D 05a), which was also his first forray into this field of Sacred music) was written between 1710 and 1712 and performed on Good Friday of the latter year in Weimar. For this version, Bach wrote two Choralsaetze: "O hilf, Christe, Gottes Sohn," BWV deest, Serie II: 002, and "O Traurigkeit, o Herzeleid," BWV deest, Serie II: 003.

In 1726 (two years after the premier of the Johannespassion and a little over halfway into his third Cantata cycle), Bach wrote a second Passionspasticcio on this work. For this (BWV deest (BC D 05b)), Bach wrote three Choralsaetze: "So gehst du nun, mein Jesu, hin," BWV 500a, "O hilf, Christe, Gottes Sohn," BWV 1084, and "O Traurigkeit, o Herzeleid," BWV deest (Serie II: 004).

Finally, between 1743 and 1748, Bach composed a third Passionspasticcio on this work. This one (BWV deest (Serie II: 005)) was a very curious affair. In addition to the main work and the first two of the three Choralsaetze mentioned in the 1726
version, Bach also borrowed at least seven Arien from Georg Friedrich Händel's Brockespassion HWV 48, namely Hallische Händelausgabe Nr. 9, Nr. 23, Nr. 41, Nr. 44, Nr. 47, Nr. 52, and Nr. 55.

[To David Glenn Lebut Jr.] Many thanks, David. Most helpful. A couple of points. You say that only the parts for the 1736 version of the SMP (BWV 244) survive but I felt sure it was the score of that version (with red ink for the libretto and the Bach-restored cover) that was included on my SACD recording of the SMP (BWV 244) by Harnoncourt (his 3rd recording, 2000/1). Please could you check this?

Also, it is generally accepted that much of the St Mark passion (BWV 247) was a paody of BWV 198 but I was under the impression that there was considerable uncertainty over the remainder of the music, so much so that both the recordings I have use music from "Keiser's" (Bruhn's?) St Mark Passion to fill in the gaps, i.e. recitatives and Turba choruses.

Actually, there was only about five or six movements of the work that was parodied from BWV 198. A couple movements (the first Turba Chorus and the one that starts "Pfui dich") were parodied from BWV 248, and the rest was unknown. While I do like the Goodman recording (which is based on Heigh's reconstruction), there are a few things I would change and actually favor in the Koopman recording. Here they are:

1.) The Tenorarie "Falsche Welt" should be sung by a Tenor, not a Counter-Tenor (which Goodman uses). Also the mood is better.

2.) The Turba Chorus "Weissage uns" is in the major (ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) in the Goodman recording (as it was in the Keiser/Bruhns Markuspassion). Koopman parodies the movement from the Matthäuspassion (BWV 244) "Weissage uns, Christe" for this movement (a better fit, I feel).

3.) Either way of the final Chorus "Bei deinem Grab und Leichenstein" is good.

No, it is not a good case in point since Bach scholars have known since at least 1869, when Wilhelm Rust pointed out in his forward to the BGA various reasons why the original form of this work is a violin concerto probably from the Köthen period. While in the interim a few scholars (Siegele one of the most prominent dissenters) have doubted Rust's conclusion and have even doubted whether this was a genuine work by Bach, the general consensus among Bach scholars today is that it is genuine and that it existed in its earliest form as a violin concerto. [Reconstructions of the violin concerto have been undertaken in the past by Ferdinand David (1873), Robert Rietz (1917) and the NBA VII/7.

From a secular instrumental work, Bach next used it (either 1726 or 1728) in a transcription for organ obbligato in mvt. 1 and with 'Vokaleinbau' (the vocal parts were overlaid/added to the original slow mvt.) in BWV 146/1,2 "Wir müssen durch viel Trübsal in das Reich Gottes eingehen". After that it reappeared in BWV 188/1 "Ich habe meine Zuversicht" (either 1728 or 1729)--this is a fragment sinfonia.

Shortly before leaving Leipzig to go to Frankfurt on the Oder in 1734, C.P.E. Bach made the first transcription of the violin concerto for harpsichord. Very likely he performed it with his Collegium musicum in Frankfurt. There is no evidence that J.S. Bach helped his son with this transcription although it is quite possible that he had suggested it as a possibility to be pursued. This version compared to J.S. Bach's own harpsichord transcription undertaken later shows many weaknesses so that no scholar would ever consider that J.S. Bach had worked on it.

Circa 1738 is the time when J.S. Bach completed the score for his own harpsichord transcription of the violin concerto. He did not use the already existing organ part for his transcription, it would have made his work even more difficult! After completing the score, the harpsichord part still underwent subsequent intensive revision. The NBA gives the original, first version in the appendix and presents the final state "Fassung letzter Hand" as its main printed version in NBA VII/4.

This is the most fascinating part of the cantata. Bach uses the opening movement as a sinfonia-type introduction. In the chorus which follows, Bach does not set the music of the concerto to words but rather superimposes wholly new vocal music over the original lines. Bach's scruples about using secular vocal music to new sacred words did not include a prohibition against using orchestral music (viz. The use of several Branderburg movements in the cantatas).

Are we saying here that the Easter Oratorio (BWV 249) is the only example of a secular cantata being reused with sacred words? What's the accepted history of the oratorio?

The question was not about the piece's origin (before use in cantatas BWV 146 and BWV 188). That's irrelevant!

The question, plain and simple (at least the question that I answered the first time!), was about the reuse of music in a secular context after it had definitely been used in sacred music, in church. These particular movements popped out of cantatas BWV 146 and BWV 188 were recast as a harpsichord concerto (obviously secular context) in the 1730s.

It does not matter what they were used for, or whatever instrumentation they might have had (violin concerto or whatnot, in whatever key), before their appearance in those two cantatas...at least for the purposes of this question!

Unless the point is simply to be disagreeable, and to negate every piece of data that is presented in support of a question.

Thanks. So I now have a few cases that require me to revise my former belief that Bach never used music for secular purposes after it had been used for sacred purposes.

I guess it´s just one of those romantic notions.

Bradley Lehman wrote (December 12, 2006):
[To Chris Rowson] For what it's worth: another example, maybe not quite so convincing, would be the case of BWV 1006a. That's the arrangement (c1736/7) for lute or keyboard from the E major violin partita. Obviously, this happened after the sacred use of its first movement in cantata BWV 29 (1731).... The original violin version was of course from c1720.

Good music is around, so keep using it for whatever, and keep revising and recasting it. What's the problem?

I played some of BWV 1006a a couple of weeks ago, in church, on piano, putting it back to sacred use.... zig. zag. zig. zag. Sounds good and it makes a joyful effect, which can be appropriate in church, so what's the problem?

I've also played Brahms's "Edward" ballade in church, without telling anybody there that the old legendary text behind it is about murder; it's a good piece of music, beautifully and powerfully dramatic with some whomping D minor, whatever imagery might accrue to it. It fit the themes of the service that day, and helped the worship move along appropriately, so I don't see a problem.

One cannot reasonably create a fictitious and selective context excluding the prior history of a composition and then declare the real origin of a piece to be irrelevant and thus arrive at the conclusion that BWV 1052 first existed in a sacred setting before it was transformed into a harpsichord concerto! Looking at the historical record selectively (and incorrectly), Tim Smith formulated a meaning of 'circulatio' that does not make sense in a historical context. The same thing is being perpetrated here by claiming that the cantata mvts. that ended up in the subsequent arrangement of the same music as a harpsichord concerto give evidence of Bach creating a secular parody of a work originally intended for a sacred setting.

The fact is that this music began as a secular composition which was parodied in a sacred setting in the cantatas. But then....

The fact is, if all the historical details surrounding these transformations are as important as they should be, Bach did not use the organ part from the cantata (this was the first time a mvt. from BWV 1052 was transcribed for a keyboard instrument) for creating the harpsichord concerto. He went straight back to the violin part original. From this standpoint it is clear that Bach was working from a secular original which he parodied/transcribed for a different instrument 20 years later.

So, let's get straight what you're making up here. Bach (according to you) DID NOT "use" (i.e. even look at) either his scores or parts of BWV BWV 146 and BWV 188, when making the concerto 1052. Rather, he used ONLY the "violin part original" which nobody alive today (except apparently you) is absolutely certain ever existed at all. Bach (according to you) DID NOT consult his own intermediate work across whatever intervening years, or even his memory in his head of having written/performed cantatas BWV 146 and BWV 188, but rather he used ONLY this other now-lost manuscript, as his sole source. If it ever existed.

And then you go right on as if it's been proven: "From this standpoint it is clear...."

HOW DO YOU KNOW THESE THINGS? The "standpoint" being whatever you've just made up, for yourself, as if it's true.

=====

I personally happen to know the first movement of harpsichord concerto 1052 quite well, having performed it by memory (way back in 1984) with a string orchestra, conducted me from the harpsichord. I know that the figuration looks really violinistic, and uses the violin's open strings, even though it's a harpsichord concerto. This is all painfully obvious, on even five minutes of studying the piece. Now, this familiarity with the piece is still not enough to convince me ABSOLUTELY that there was ever a violin-concerto original. There probably was, sure.

And yet there's still an unbridgeable chasm between this (the notion that a violin-concerto original probably existed) and the assertion that Bach somehow used ONLY such a version (and none of the cantata material, even his own memory of it) to fashion 1052. Why would Bach ever make such a categorical and pedantic distinction: such that sacred material (namely BWV 146/BWV 188) must never be "used" or consulted (or even thought about) again, when refashioning similar musical materials into a new piece?

I'm not sure that this is an instance of 'romanticization'. I think, rather, that it gives a psychorigid image of Bach. As has been previously suggested, I prefer to think of Bach's as a personality of many aspects, not excluding a peculiar, tongue-in-cheek, form of humour. But apparently for the general public Bach was a no-nonsense guy, rather boring, and who wrote rather boring stuff.

I always read that Bach never used a sacred vocal work with a new secular text -- but the reverse many times. The use of "abstract" instrumental works did not seem to be a problem and we see those works passing through all vocal genres. Is this a principle which Bach actually stuck with, or is it a Romantic projection designed to protect modern listeners' prudishness?

Bradley Lehman wrote (December 12, 2006):
BWV 205, 205a, and 171

[To Douglas Cowling] Well, how about BWV 205, the secular piece about Aeolus? August 1725, according to BWV. Its movement 9 is about "Angenehmer Zephyrus", with text written by Henrici.

That movement then got used as movement 4 of sacred cantata BWV 171 "Gott, wie dein Name", for New Year's Day 1729. Its sung text (also by Henrici) there, as movement 4, is "Jesus soll mein erstes Wort..."

Now flip over to BWV 205a, for the coronation of August III, in January 1734. Secular piece here, in praise of this earthly ruler, and movement 9 is this same one we've been talking about: but now its text is "Grosser König unsrer Zeit...."

Secular - sacred - secular.

Now all the dodgy business comes in, where this transubstantiation can be weaseled out of.

BWV 205a is actually a reconstruction where the music has been lost, and only the text survives. If we didn't want to acknowledge that Bach used a sacred piece (BWV 171/4) later as secular (BWV 205a/9) we'd at least need to assert that the NBA has reconstructed this lost piece incorrectly; we'd also perhaps need to assert that Bach didn't actually use (or consult) the BWV 171 version at all, but worked only from BWV 205 source which was secular to begin with. BWV 205a/9 and BWV 171/4 could somehow be wholly independent branches off a common source (BWV 205/9), where Bach maybe forgot or ignored the fact that he had transmuted the thing to a sacred piece in 1729.... Like Pooh-Bah, it's as if the BWV 171 version wasn't even there; how convenient.

The BWV also offers another dodge: the conjecture that BWV 171 might be mis-dated, and that its first production might have occurred as late as 1736 or 1737...which puts it safely after BWV 205a, having the secular occurrence come up last. ["zum 1.1.1729 (oder in einem der folgenden Jahre? oder erst um 1736/37?)"] Aw, come on! The text by Henrici, as it says right here in the BWV 171 entry, is from 1728...the circumstantial evidence indicating that Henrici and Bach probably put this together expressly for the 1729 production.

Apparently under the incoming rulership of August III, according to movement 13 of BWV 205a, "Schwarze Raben werden eher Schwaene haben". What a Bird-Dude!

That's Ok if you limit the question. There are a lot of threads here suggested by Chris's original posting that I find myself in some disagreement with.

1 There is , as I see it no problem. Whether the music is good or not ( most on this list would agree that it is) is not relevant to this particular discussion.

2 Some have described Bach's re-use of his music in a one way only street as a 'Romantic notion'. Why? What is romantic about it? The bulk of evidence is that he did not secularise deified music and there are many examples. The remaining question is, was this always his practice or did he sometimes depart from it? This is a matter of some interest to me if to noone else.

3 Whether the D minor keyboard concerto was itself an arrangement of a pre-exiting violin concerto (supported by some slightly ambivalent evidence as I explained earlier) seems to form a relevant part of this discussion. If the original conception was secular (and perhaps from the Köthen period) then Bach follows the practice of deifying the secular. The fact that he might have gone back to his original source to arrange a later keyboard concerto (when he was in his University directorship and required a number of such concerti for himself, his students and his sons) does nothing to destroy the established belief of his general practice. The order would then have been secular, ecclesiastical, secular---not a commonly established practice of Bach's but a possible one.

Of course it does not advance an argument to say that he 'may' have composed a piece in a different form, now lost. But he still may have done. My conclusions would be that

1 mostly the process was one way

2 it is possible that it was always one way, although this cannot be proven

3 it is also possible that he made exceptions--Bach, always the great pragmatist ---and

4 discussion of this point remains interesting, not in itself a problem, and it does not reflect in any way on the greatness of the music itself.

I agree with JM´s conclusions in general, particularly that the issue does not reflect in any way on the greatness of the music.

But I grew up believing in the one-way street, and more recently found it apparently confirmed by modern scholarship, and I have shaped my understanding of JSB to include this.

But now it appears clear that the one-way street was not entirely one-way. For me, that is a very significant development. In this context, there is for me an enormous difference between "one-way" and "mostly one-way". I am facing a substantial change in my understanding of JSB.

In this thread it is not a question of whether Bach did or did not peek at the instrumental parts of the cantatas that may have contained a mvt. or two of what eventually became the harpsichord concerto BWV 1052 and which in its original form did once exist as a complete violin concerto before parts of it were used in the cantatas mentioned. The focus must be upon the determination by the NBA editors that Bach did not base the harpsichord part of his transcription for that instrument upon the most likely already existing keyboard verwion: the solo obbligato organ part (BWV 146/1). Here was an already existing keyboard part and yet Bach did not use it for working out his transcription of this music for the harpsichord. Had I been asked politely by anyone concerning the reasons for this point, I would probably been able to give further interesting details about the methods used to make this determination.

My own hypothesis about this instrumental music remains a simple one: that Bach had decently effective music in hand and used it for whatever purposes seemed suitable at the time. I don't think that such a distinction of secular vs ecclesiastical necessarily had much of a bearing, one way or another, as to any resistance of secularizing (or re-secularizing) the material. Music is music.

Why wouldn't Bach simply bring his organ part of BWV 146 over to the new harpsichord concerto version, with few or no changes? Some possibilities that occur to me, some or all of which may have been factors:

- The thing is being rewritten anyway to omit the oboes from the orchestra, and to omit all the singers from the second movement!, so why not do a more extensive overhaul to the solo part (as BWV 1052 demonstrates) as well?

- The organ solo part has nothing of interest for the left hand to do; it just doesn't make a very impressive effect when played on harpsichords.

- The organ solo part is arguably too easy to play, if one wants a harpsichord concerto solo to give one's students any challenge. (The BWV 1052 version is MUCH more difficult....)

- Harpsichords "carry" less acoustically than the organ, and it's a musical virtue to add more oomph: a new and more active left-hand part that takes advantage of the extra low notes (GG, AA, BBb, BB) that aren't available on organ keyboards.

- Much of the organ part lies rather low, with the right-hand stuff going far down into the bass register...and on organs there are some 4-foot, 2-foot, and other upperwork stops available...but not on harpsichord. In the harpsichord version, some of that right-hand stuff itself gets transposed up an octave where it will be more brilliant, not even needing to use the 4-foot stop (if one is even available, which many harpsichords don't have and don't need).

- There's at least one spot in the organ version where the player definitely has to use two manuals, because both hands are playing independent melodic material in the same low octave. The harpsichord version works fine in that analogous passage when played on a single manual, since the bass line has been taken down an octave (also taking advantage of the low BBb and its neighbors that aren't available on the organ keyboard). The hands don't crash into each other, as the music has been written differently [so they won't].

- In the organ version there's about half a page where the organist is merely given chords on which to improvise figuration suitably. In the harpsichord version this passage is worked out to be some difficult and interlocked figuration for both hands together...again making the piece arguably more brilliant...without necessarily having anything to do with sacred/ecclesiastical distinctions. (Bach wasn't averse to using brilliant and difficult instrumental parts in other vocal pieces, or difficult vocal parts either, for that matter.)

- The organ version looks so rudimentary, maybe Bach didn't have much time available during its compositional process, while he had more leisure to work out details when doing the harpsichord version?

- Some of the interlocked-hand passages--the ones that look like violinistic open-string alternations--are the same in both the organ version and harpsichord version. This at least mildly argues that Bach worked in part from his organ version to make the next one, rather than completely independently inventing exactly the same thing twice.

  It seems to me that most or all of these points are merely about having second (or third or fourth or whatever) compositional thoughts, about handling the material to greater effect. New instrumentation, so use it idiomatically and rethink whatever needs to be rethought. Rework the piece until it goes well in its new gig. That's just good compositional process, not having anything to do one way or another with secular/ecclesiastical considerations.

  And, I don't see that it's especially a virtue for either of these keyboard versions to sound like a putative violin original. The music is not being played on a violin, so what would be the point of keeping it close to such a reading?

  I have no objections to reconstructed violin versions either, and I enjoy listening to them; I've heard several such versions of this concerto, and the others. Just saying that any previously existing violin version of this, if there ever was one, doesn't give me anything compelling one way or anotherabout the sacred/secular question!

  More to the point perhaps, here is my contribution.

  The 'one way street rule' holds true in almost all case.

  The only case which may be an exception to the rule is somewhat debatable.

  In matters touching to human behaviour rules often have exceptions (perhaps this is specific to the south of France, butone way streets are sometimes used the wrong way).

  That this rule should suffer only one exception, and that, somewhat dubious, is a remarkable fact in itself.

  At this stage I conclude that the rule is valid. Which doesn't mean that Bach deliberately decided not to, he just happened not to.

  Moreoer I fail to see in what sense the rule is 'romantic'. But having been taxed of romanticism before, I'm probably not the best suited to judge in these matters! In any case, if someone proved that the rule is not valid, I would not feel perturbed in the least.

A sweeping characterization such as the one given above is a certain indication of someone who is willing to forgive all that does not live up to the standards that all professional organizations and performers should have.

Did he have voices which could hardly be heard on certain notes? Did these voices sing lightly and fast with little support in a sotto voce style?

  This may be overstating the notion that all of Bach's music (for him at least) would be reusable equally in both as sacred and secular.

  Possible objections:

  Mattheson, Heinichen and possibly some other German theorists as well held to the distinctions between the composing and performaing styles: Church vs. Chamber vs. Opera. The bulk of Bach's compositions moved from secular to sacred and not vice versa. Often a secular cantata would be composed at one time within months of its use as a sacred cantata: the Easter Oratorio (BWV 249). This seems to indicate to me that Bach conceived in advance just how one secular cantata would be used in a sacred setting as well. Of course, I still maintain that certain arias were more difficult to transform. The original conception for the secular has a more perfect union of words and music, but the music even in its sacred form works well too, but the connection between words and music has become a bit more abstract. The word-painting is then not quite as effective, but not enough to bother Bach or most listeners. The same is true when certain solo instrumental parts change from an oboe, for instance to a violin or flute. There is characteristic writing which is appropriate for each instrument, but one stands out as much better than the others, although the potential for transcribing the part for other instruments will not seriously undermine Bach's music.

  With effort, however, Bach could transform a violin concerto into a harpsichord concerto, but it entailed bringing to bear upon this transcription everything that he knew about the harpsichord so that its uniqueness could be made apparent to the listener. This meant that many changes had to be made in the way that the same music would now be presented on an entirely different instrument.

  What follows [I have deleted that text since it has already been presented twice], after having resisted vehemently the possibility that Bach did not base the harpsichord part for BWV 1052 on the previously existing organ part, is a list of conjectures, many of them reasonable to prove that Bach would have more easily based his transcription upon the violin solo original which most likely was still in his possession at the time.

  By using the violin concerto directly, Bach could avoid having to work backward from his changed orchestration in the cantata versions. It was much easier to work directly from the violin concerto (from the Köthen period) which he most likely still had in his possession.

  The obbligato organ part in the cantata had numerous deficiencies just because it was a violin part considerably changed to make it playable on an organ. Various differences can be listed: differences in the size and number of the keyboards between organ and harpsichord; the fact that the left-hand part is not fully utilized (it is surmised that it may have been composed with a 12-year-old C.P.E. Bach or 16-year-old W.F. Bach in mind.) etc.

  The resulting harpsichord concerto is an improved composition making full use of the characteristics that a harpsichord has to offer. The best course of action which Bach chose was to work directly from the score of the violin concerto which would still have been, it is reasonable to assume, in his possession. Could Bach have worked from the cantata scores? Yes, but the enprocess of transcription would have been much more tedious and cumbersome. Being eminently efficient, Bach would have chosen the easier, more reliable course of transcribing from the existing score of the violin concerto.

But the lovely "Sheep may safely graze" from BWV 208 evokes Luther's concept of the paternalistic state whose major role is to protect the people from disorder that could make the worship and contemplation of God more difficult. I would be most wary of classifying that particular movement as "secular" in the Lutheran context. Maybe he thought instrumental music was in a different category. Maybe he didn't do it consciously. Maybe he didn't care. There's a long list of maybes.)

  I can remember reading that Wolff made the point that secular music was not used in sacred works. Did other musicologists do so as well? If so, would it be inappropriate to pass this question on to people who may have the right background and interest in the subject to offer informed comment?

       Secular/sacred

       As we all know, some of the secular music is powerfully moving, even spiritual, while some of the sacred music has been considered to have `opera buffa' elements.

       But the idea of the text of the magnificent `Sanctus' (ie, the one eventually finding its way into the BMM) being changed to celebrate some bigwig's birthday strikes me as, well, sacrilegious! I'm certainly surprised to learn that Bach did this, quite apart from any supposed Romantic era mythology saying that sacred to secular never happened.

       I've set out my stall on this which is basically-- 1 he issue is probably interesting rather than significant for most people and 2 the evidence is largely of a one way process; but this makes exceptions possibly significant.

       But may I be permitted to add two further points one specific, one general

       1 General. It is my conviction that Bach consciously composed his cantatas on more than one level especially with reference to the imagery. Some is so obvious that I believe he would have expected that most attentive people in the congregations would have recognised it---e.g. treading footsteps, smoke rising in the air. But some is to abstruse that it takes study of scores, relistenings and (on this list apparently) even a certain degree of rancourous argument to establish its existence and possible meanings. This (I suggest) was written more for God than for man.

       It follows then that Bach may well have had a conscious sense of writing for people on the one hand and God on the other---can't be proven of course, any more than the existance of God can be proven but I believe it to be true (the former rather than the latter contention, that is!) Bach being Bach could write for both at the same time; but if there is any credence in this view of his work it could well follow that he had a clearly defined concept of who he was writing for and how he might write for them.

       True, it appears that he may have written everything 'for the glory of God" ---but this does not exclude the possibility that he may also have had certain particular emphases within works written for different purposes. The immense subtlety of his mind, clearly demonstrated in a variety of contexts, convinces me that this is a strong possiblity. If he thought of different images as being appropriate for different receptive ears within movements, he may well have taken the same view of complete works written originally for either ecclesiastical and secular functions.

       I hope this is clearly stated--it's a personal conviction about his music (similar I think to that expressed by Chris) and a way for me to penetrate further into the man's complex and endlessly rewarding art. You can agree or not---but please don't come back by saying 'it's all great music so what does it matter?' which frankly I find patronising. There are some rather deep convictions here which I think, a bulk of evidence supports (if not proving beyond doubt) and frankly I am with Chris on this one.

       2 Specific. Like Brad I have also performed the great D minor concerto and consider it the finest and most focussed of all Baroque keyboard concerti. Playing it from memory is a marvellous musical discipline--the keyboard player has no rest,lapsing back into the role of continuo when not playing solo--around 25 minutes without a break!

       But I wanted to draw attention to a moment in the first movement which comes after that burst of quick notes mentioned by Brad, at the end of the magnificent cadenza. There is an impressive climax taking us back to what must surely be the final statement of the octave- ritornello theme. But Bach fools us--it turns out not to be, for he slips into an earlier excursion before finally sttling on the closing ritornello statement.

       For me this is Bach's wit/sense of humour/practical joking---call it what you like. Even in a piece of this emotional intensity he works in a moment apparently saying to himself---there that fooled them for a moment! An instant of wit for the cognitive musicians--after all, with his family and students he had plenty of them around him.

It really should not matter whether one is dead or alive in regard to editing the OCC, particularly with the help of another assistant editor who is more busy asserting without evidence that Bach probably could not even play his own Goldberg Variations (BWV 988) during the last few years of his life.

       2. One cannot reasonably do what is described in 1. above.

Well, now that that has been cleared up at least to my satisfaction, I would like to comment about the sacred <--> secular migration of Bach's parody process. (If this is not what is being talked about, well then, never mind, as Gilda Radner would say...)

"It is not what goes into a man that profanes him, but what comes out of a man." This joke (used as a serious point), attributed to Jesus, is a central doctrine of the Christian Church. It is far easier to sanctify a building, or person, or object for sacred use, than to "de-commission" a sacred thing for non-religious ("profane") use. In the old world, up to the early part of the 20th century, if the time came when a church, for instance, needed to be now put to non-religious use, there was a rather serious, well-defined ceremony for the de-sanctification. (In modern America, though, I doubt whether such a procedure is followed, but it is a sufficiently rare occurrence that the ceremony may go unnoticed.)

I am not an expert, but it is possible that in the New Testament, the Apostle Paul may have elucidated the theological principles involved. Sanctifying the ordinary things for sacred use: yes. To de-sanctify: hardly imaginable, to be done only in extreme need.

Absolutism and religious principle --there is a thin grey line. For those of no religious persuasion who struggle to understand Bach and the axioms of his thought-processes, this principle of one-way-traffic might sound like rigidity, dogmaticism, etc. But it is not hard to understand. Christians have long held that creation was in the process of being sanctified, until one day all would be holy. Even if it seems far fetched, it is easy to see how difficult it must have been (for Bach) to work against this process.

That's essentially what I said yesterday about the practical differences between the organ and harpsichord versions of this movement; viz. these excerpts:

< - The organ solo part has nothing of interest for the left hand to do; it just doesn't make a very impressive effect when played on harpsichords.
- The organ solo part is arguably too easy to play, if one wants a harpsichord concerto solo to give one's students any challenge. (The BWV 1052 version is MUCH more difficult....)
- Harpsichords "carry" less acoustically than the organ, and it's a musical virtue to add more oomph: a new and more active left-hand part that takes advantage of the extra low notes (GG, AA, BBb, BB) that aren't available on organ keyboards.
- Much of the organ part lies rather low, with the right-hand stuff going far down into the bass register...and on organs there are some 4-foot, 2-foot, and other upperwork stops available...but not on > harpsichord. In the harpsichord version, some of that right-hand stuff itself gets transposed up an octave where it will be more brilliant, not even needing to use the 4-foot stop (if one is even available, which many harpsichords don't have and don't need).
- There's at least one spot in the organ version where the player definitely has to use two manuals, because both hands are playing independent melodic material in the same low octave. The harpsichord version works fine in that analogous passage when played on a single manual, since the bass line has been taken down an octave (also taking advantage of the low BBb and its neighbors that aren't available on the organ keyboard). The hands don't crash into each other, as the music has been written differently [so they won't].
- In the organ version there's about half a page where the organist is merely given chords on which to improvise figuration suitably. In the harpsichord version this passage is worked out to be some difficult and interlocked figuration for both hands together...again making the piece arguably more brilliant...without necessarily having anything to do with sacred/ecclesiastical distinctions. (Bach wasn't averse to using brilliant and difficult instrumental parts in other vocal pieces, or difficult vocal parts either, for that matter.)
  It seems to me that most or all of these points are merely about having second (or third or fourth or whatever) compositional thoughts, about handling the material to greater effect. New instrumentation, so use it idiomatically and rethink whatever needs to be rethought.
  Rework the piece until it goes well in its new gig. That's just good compositional process, not having anything to do one way or another with secular/ecclesiastical considerations.
  And, I don't see that it's especially a virtue for either of these keyboard versions to sound like a putative violin original. The music is not being played on a violin, so what would be the point of keeping it close to such a reading? >
  Bach knew how to write well and idiomatically for harpsichord, making effective changes to his musso it would sound good as "presented on an entirely different instrument". I'm glad we agree.

  Bach's parody of the St Matthew Passion, BWV 244a

  More food for thought on this parody business:

  In March 1729 Bach took ten movements of the early version of the St Matthew Passion, plus two movements from cantata 198 (the "Lass, Fürstin" funeral music), plus eleven newly-composed movements...and put together funeral music for prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen.

  Granted, it's still an ecclesiastical occasion. Nevertheless, the engraving of a local and temporal prince is a step down from the dramatic suffering and engraving of JC (i.e. the overarching theme of the St Matthew Passion). The movements borrowed from SMP (BWV 244) are shuffled around to a different sequence, too, in addition to being given new texts specifically about Leopold.

  Perhaps I miss something, but after rereading Wolff it does not appear that he writes specifically that Bach did not employ any sacred music in secular music. The examples he uses (such as the XO which dwarfs in importance the work others are discussing as an example of sacred to secular parody) are to show Bach's irrepressible "summa" mentality and include some that go from secular to sacred and none the other way. That doesn't mean it didn't happen.

  Does anyone know which musicologist first noticed this aspect of Bach's works? Considering Bach's productivity it must have been someone who had great knowledge of his works. Is there any possibility that this is a point that come up after some East German scholars made the attempt (no doubt to please their craven masters and further their careers) to cast Bach as an early day Voltaire when it was discovered that most of Bach's religious cantatas were composed in a very short period? It bothered the East German government no end that their most famous composer was so closely associated with the Lutheran Church any anything that could be done to prove that Bach was a simple careerist who composed religious music to keep the family fed instead of sincerely praising God was "music to their ears". (It would be interesting to query Ms. Merkel on such points.) As I understand it, many Bach defenders outside the East German intellectual jail countered such claims. I wonder if the matter being discussed here figured into this debate.

  (BTW: this doesn't mean there was no good scholarship in the late, hopefully unlamented German People's Republic. I used to read a lot of it. The problem was sifting through the work and ascertaining at what point it was safe to take the scholar at his word and at what point the scholar as writing for the Party hacks that made his/her career. It wasn't always easy. What was funny was how easy it was to get East German scholars to "wink wink" "nod nod" on the subject when discussing it informally, preferably with some beer under the belt.)

  SMP BWV 244a & b

  Aryeh Oron has placed the following research paper on the origin, history, chronology of Bach's SMP (BWV 244) and its connection to/with its secular 'sister' work BWV 244a.

  It can be found at the following address (as a PDF file): http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Articles/SMP244avsb.pdf

  This investigation was prompted by the recent discussion of parodies, particularly from sacred to secular, and, interestingly enough, touches upon another topic recently discussed, the Sanctus in D (later in the Mass in B minor), which was performed on Christmas Day in 1724. The loss of key evidence has prompted endless speculation about the early form of the SMP (BWV 244) and the date for its first performance. Recent research by Andreas Glöckner in the NBA KB from 2004 calls into question many previous commentaries and assessments regarding chronology and the relationship between both works. This now outdated information is, however, still to be found in books and articles before this date, more recently circa 2000: Wolff, Geck, Küster, Robin A Leaver's article on the SMP (BWV 244) in the OCC (1999), etc.

  The complexity surrounding this subject matter should not hinder an interested reader from grasping the essential details of the various arguments that have been presented pro and con regarding specific theories
  offered by a variety of Bach experts for well over a century now.

  I do not wish to begin a long discussion on this subject now, since our primary focus should be on this week's cantata discussion, but any questions, corrections, or suggestions would be welcome.

  Simon Heighes twice made such a claim in the OCC (1999) which information is now outdated by the scholarship presented in the NBA KB II/9 (2000) pp. 98-103 where it is made clear that Reinhard Keiser composed all or almost all of the St. Mark Passion which Bach performed in Weimar and in Leipzig. There are 2 chorales from the Weimar and 3 from the Leipzig version which may 'possibly' be 4-pt.settings by Bach, but even these are somewhat questionable. All the rest of the St. Mark Passion is not by Bach (not his original music). The music for this Passion does not appear in the NBA. The St. Mark Passion by Reinhard Keiser, depending upon which version you have in mind, contains 7 arias by Händel from the Brockes Passion.

  Question: Why would Bach create a parody of a work which was not his own composition to begin with? Bach did some arrangements of works by other composers. These are clearly documented and Bach indicated the original source in his autograph arrangements (when they still exist for us to inspect). Has anyone heard or read of evidence where Bach 'lifted' music, whether sacred or secular, from another composer and reused it with a different text as part of his figural music to be performed in the Leipzig churches?

  Bach may have emulated the style of the turbae that appear in the "Weihnachtshistorien" (the 'Christmas stories') of other composers of the 17th century, but he would not need to copy some other composer's music to compose BWV 248/45. The use of turbae is a very old, if not almost ancient musical tradition in the churches of Germany before Bach's time.

  Rogier Michael (1554-1619) served the Dresden Court for over 40 years as a singer and court Capellmeister. In addition to composing a number of Passions (now lost), he also set to music two other Biblical Stories/Histories: "The Conception" ("Empfängnis-Historie") and "The Story/History of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ" ("Historia von der Geburt unsers Herren Jesu Christi")[both works from 1602]. In the latter the turbae are the choruses of the shepherds at one point and the the 3 kings at another.

  Douglas Cowling wrote/asked:
  >>What's the difference between "arranging" and "lifting" another composer's work?<<
  Most of Bach's arrangements of sacred music by other composers are properly declared by Bach as coming from another composer. Bach may have reworked the music substantially (learning from it, but also improving it, sometimes even changing the Latin text in one mvt. as in the Sanctus BWV 241 - by Kerll), but if Bach's autograph title still exists, it would read thus: "Missa...di A. Lotti" or "Magnificat...di A. Caldara" or "Sanctus..." (BWV 241) with no composer noted - Bach always gave himself credit for a sacred composition if it was his own. When Bach, for purposes of supplying figural music for the Leipzig churches, arranged and/or 'lifted' music composed by others, he made a clear attempt to attribute its source properly even if he had revised, modified, arranged, and changed it in numerous ways. This is not the case with the usual parodies we encounter in Bach's music (WO, etc.), where he 'lifts' his own music from one context, changes the text entirely, often with little or no change to the original music/orchestration, and places it into a new and very different context. It is my contention that with BWV 248/45, Bach would not have 'lifted' the music from Reinhard Keiser's turba chorus in his St. Mark's Passion (BWV 247) without attributing its source properly. Also, as we have found out, Bis not creating a parody of his own music here. It is also my contention that there was a general style factor, a traditional form or sound attached to all turbae whether for Passions or for Christmas music. It is this turba-style which the listener will note as being different from the rest of the composition when hearing the turbae in Bach's Passions and Christmas Oratorio (BWV 248).

  Well, how many such cases are there? Are there such autographs of the Pergolesi & Kuhnau arrangements, for example? I know the arrangement of the Couperin trio (from L'Imperiale, I think) is unattributed, though I'm not sure offhand if the source is in JSB's hand.

  With the possible exception of 5 4-pt. chorale settings from the St. Mark Passion by Reinhard Keiser, none of the music contained therein is by J. S. Bach.

  Bach continued using and modifying Keiser's music during the various performances of this Passion music in Weimar and in Leipzig. In the final performance in the late 1740s (again with extensive modification, but not the inclusion of parodies of his own music but rather in the form of a Pasticcio, Bach even included 7 arias from Handel's Brockes Passion (HWV 48).

  >>(And btw, in which piece's KB does this come up?) Is it that Reinhart's score has been rediscovered in the form used by JSB on two occasions?<<
  The NBA KB I had cited gives a side-by-side, mvt. by mvt. comparison of Bach's 5 different versions of Keiser's score which were modified and performed under Bach's directiion. This is all the result of more recent research.

  >>My previous understanding is that the libretto (or a copy made before 1944) of the Mark Passion is the only basis for speculation about the lost music.<<
  The libretto for Keiser's St. Mark Passion along with the music has never been lost or are you referring here to the Picander text? A recent practical edition, edited by Hans Bergmann and published in Stuttgart in 1996 carries the title: "Passio secundum Marcum. Markuspassion" by Reinhard Keiser in the version as performed by J. S. Bach at the court in Weimar circa 1713.

  >>John Butt's program notes for last week's Philharmonia Baroque concerts repeats the presumption that this XO chorus is indeed recycled, but perhaps he wrote those notes for the 1995 performances by the same group.<<
  This contention may be right as long as it is clear that Bach is not recycling his own music here.

  >>Well, how many such cases are there? Are there such autographs of the Pergolesi & Kuhnau arrangements, for example?<<
  The Pergolesi transcription BWV 1083 is again of a very late origin (1746-1747). There is no composer indicated in the title (for his own composition, Bach adds his name at the end of the title).

  "Der Gerechte kommt um (BWV deest), once attributed to Johann Kuhnau's "Tristis est anima mea", is now considered to be by an anonymous composer. It is mvt. 39 of a Passion Cantata "Wer ist der, so von Edom kömmt". This is not a valid case for answering the above question.

  >>I know the arrangement of the Couperin trio (from L'Imperiale, I think) is unattributed, though I'm not sure offhand if the source is in JSB's hand.<<
  The authenticity of BWV 587 is very much in doubt: "So ist die Zuschreibung dieser Übertragung [BWV 587] an Bach durch die Überlieferung nur schwach beglaubigt."

  NBA KB IV/8 p. 95

  One of the original questions in this thread focused on Heighes' claim that two mvts. from Bach's St. Mark's Passion, now known to be almost entirely by Reinhard Keiser and not by Bach, although Bach performed various versions (5) of it in Weimar and Leipzig, that two turbae "Ja nicht auf das Fest" and "Pfui dich" were parodied in the WO. As given in great detail in the NBA KB, there is only one chorus (no. 22b "Pfui dich") which appears in any of the versions that Bach performed. Whether "Ja nicht auf das Fest" is in the original Keiser Passion, but not in Bach's version, I cannot determine here. If it can be ascertained that the latter chorus by Keiser containes exactly the same music as the turbae in Bach's WO, do we call this a parody as well?

  From a broader perspective, any transcription/arrangement by Bach of another composer's work is a parody. This would mean that Bach parodied a number of Handel arias in his performance of the St. Mark Passion which contained almost or no original music of his own.

  Daniel R Melamed's article on 'Parody' in the OCC makes clear that there are various definitions of parody that can be applied to Bach's music: 1. Bach can parody a style with a satirical effect; 2. Bach can 'retext' any music to make it serve his immediate purpose (this may involve little or no modification in the music/orchestration); 3. Bach can assemble various mvts. from his other works (or even occasionally from those of other composers) in order to create a single, structured composition containing a number of mvts. some of which (like recitatives) have to be composed anew.

  It would appear that generally the factor of retexting the music is an important element in defining a Bach parody, but what do we call Bach's use of Handel arias in a Passion which contains little or possibly none of Bach's original music? Can we call any compositions (instrumental or otherwise, by Bach or by other composers) which have been modified by Bach in any way, even with the slightest changes, 'parodies'? Is the meaning of 'parody' as applied to Bach being used in a sense that is becoming so general that it begins to lose its significance? Perhaps it has been my misconceptiall along that Bach parodies had to involve his own music. These new, broad definitions of 'parody' would mean that the turbae mentioned by Heighes may well be instances of Bach 'lifting', copying, integrating, adding new text to the turbae that were Reinhard Keiser's original composition for his own St. Mark Passion.

  < Simon Heighes twice made such a claim in the OCC (1999) which information is now outdated by the scholarship presented in the NBA KB II/9 (2000) pp. 98-103 where it is made clear that Reinhard Keiser composed all or almost all of the St. Mark Passion which Bach performed in Weimar and in Leipzig. There are 2 chorales from the Weimar and 3 from the Leipzig version which may 'possibly' be 4-pt.settings by Bach, but even these are somewhat questionable. All the rest of the St. Mark Passion is not by Bach (not his original music). The music for this Passion does not appear in the NBA. The St. Mark Passion by Reinhard Keiser, depending upon which version you have in mind, contains 7 arias by Handel from the Brockes Passion.
  Question: Why would Bach create a parody of a work which was not his own composition to begin with? Bach did some arrangements of works by other composers. These are clearly documented and Bach indicated the original source in his autograph arrangements (when they still exist for us to inspect). Has anyone heard or read of evidence where Bach 'lifted' music, whether sacred or secular, from another composer and reused it with a different text as part of his figural music to be performed in the Leipzig churches?
  Bach may have emulated the style of the turbae that appear in the "Weihnachtshistorien" (the 'Christmas stories') of other composers of the 17th century, but he would not need to copy some other composer's music to compose BWV 248/45. The use of turbae is a very >
  Today I had a lovely walk under cloudless skies to Davis' Shields Library for a quick look at NBA KB II/9. It has nothing to do with XO, (which is vol 6, from the early 1960's) but deals with Latin church music, Passions: opera dubia, arrangements and formerly attributed works. The Passions are the Luke, which gets a long and what looks like an interesting discusion, and the Mark Passion of Keiser {this has been printed in the Stuttgardt edition]. The later we know to have been performed by JSB at Weimar (1712) and Leipzig (1726) on the basis of parts copied in Bach's hand. There are several other sources, including a JCFB cembalo-part from around 1743-8 with figuring added by JSB. There are indeed chorals that dont apear in the independent sources, but as far as I can tell, there has never been any question of this representing a 'lost' JSB work. The KB does not refer to Heighes, indeed the only reference in the article is to Melamed & Sanders in BJ 1999, which is said to be superceeded (I didnt have time to look and see what superceded claims they made).

  The KB makes no effort to address the question of whether Bach ever composed a lost M-P, nor is XO mentioned even in passing. It's hard to prove a negative but I suppose the parody case is somewhat weakened if Bach had another work available for the occasions he is known to have needed a M-P and IF these are the only likely times. I think, though, Thomas might have made clear from the beginning that this was his own contribution, not that of the NBA.

  With your help and input, I believe that I can now properly sort out the problem involved. Laboring under the mistaken impression that Bach composed or had a hand in composing some sections of a St. Mark Passion which he performed in Weimar and Leipzig and that most of the music was based on Reinhard Keiser's St. Mark Passion with later inclusion of some Handel arias from the Brockes Passion, I had thought that the issue was resolved. However, this is not the case with Bach and his St. Mark Passion performances. There is one instance, on March 23, 1731, when Bach presented a St. Mark Passion based upon a Picander text that was printed in one of Picander's books. Not a single scrap of the music for this St. Mark Passion BWV 247 has survived, but ever since Wilhelm Rust, editor of the BGA Vol. XX, made his discovery of possible correspondences between existing works (BWV 198 and possibly one or two other cantatas which were parodied), Spitta, Smend and others have speculated about which movements came from earlier Bach compositions.

  The summary that Simon Heighes gives in the OCC is a good introduction to this work: BWV 247 and its history. He does not indicate who discovered the possible reuse (parody) of the turbae of BWV 247 in the WO BWV 248. This discovery was made by Gerhard Freiesleben ("Ein neuer Beitrag zur Entstehungsgeschichte von J. S. Bachs Weihnachts-Oratorium", Neue Zeitschrift für Musik, Issue 83, 1916, pp. 237ff.). The fact that Simon Heighes and A. H. Gomme have prepared practical editions of BWV 247, but have included recitatives and turbae composed by Reinhard Keiser only serves to cloud the issue which prompted this research: Freiesleben, back in 1916, worked in reverse. He took the existing turbae in the WO and found that they fit Picander's text portion used in Bach's 1731 performance. Now, however, Heighes and Gomme use/include turbae from Keiser's Passion as well. Have they kept apart Bach's compositions from Keiser's or are we to assume that Bach copied/parodied Keiser's turbae in the 1731 performance, which he subsequently parodied in the WO. The BWV Verzeichnis gives BWV 247/39 as the original form of BWV 248/45. We know from the detailed description of Keiser's Passion in the NBA KB II/9 that mvt. 22b of the Keiser Passion is "Pfui dich". Can we assume that "Ja nicht auf das Fest" which is not by Keiser is a composition by Bach? How do Heighes and Gomme know this when not a single tiny bit of BWV 247 has survived? Just where does "Ja nicht auf das Fest" come from? Who composed it? Does it come from another Bach Passion? If that is the case, why not state it clearly?

  Summary:

  There are two separate versions of theSt. Mark Passion which Bach performed during his lifetime:

  1. BWV 247 (all music lost, but Picander text survives) consisted most likely of many parodies of other works by Bach with the recitatives being composed new for the single performance in 1731 and which did not receive a repeat performance.

  2. Reinhard Keiser's Passion which Bach modified, added some chorale settings and even 'lifted' some of Handel's arias from the Brockes Passion. There is very little music by Bach in this Passion which he performed once in Weimar and at least twice in Leipzig. This Passion was performed at least 3 times by Bach!

     The only source for the Picander (Henrici) libretto appeared in "Picanders Ernst=Schertzhaffte und Satyrische Gedichte, Dritter Theil" Leipzig, 1732. Facsimiles of the St. Mark Passion as well as other cantatas have appeared in various NBA KBs. It does not appear that a sole copy was destroyed, for there must be a number of copies of this book still in existence. If a copy was destroyed during bombs, there will still others which could replace it for ascertaining the libretto for the St. Mark Passion that Bach used for the 1731 Good Friday performance.

     Alfred Dürr on pp. 248-266 of NBA KB II/5 gives a complete analysis of what is and what is not considered a parody in BWV 247 (St. Mark Passion - Bach's composition for which all scores and parts have been lost). "Ja nicht auf das Fest" BWV 247/2b does not reappear in the BWV 248 (WO), nor is it a parody of an earlier work. "Wir haben gehöret" BWV 247/25b = BWV 248/28(?) "Lasset uns nun gehen"; "Pfui dich" BWV 247/39b = BWV 248/45 "Wo, wo" (possibly). "Ja nicht auf das Fest" BWV 247/2b is claimed by Heighes to 'possibly' reappear in the WO (BWV 248), but this contention is not confirmed by Alfred Dürr, who does not see a connection between this and mvt. in the WO.

     I would respectfully suggest that the proposers communicate, and agree on one or the other. The acronyms are enough of a challenge without creating an additional point of contention and confusion.

     My vote goes to XO, because of the pending suggestion to get Martell XO Cognac to sponsor discussions. Although I am partial to Martell, I believe Courvoisier also makes an XO. I do not believe there is a WO Cognac. Enough said.

     Peter Smaill wrote (December 29, 2006):
     The complex history of the settings in Bach's hand, performed by Bach or written by Bach of the St Mark Passion are set out in Daniel R Melamed's "Hearing Bach's Passions". He states that no musical material survives for the 1731 version but, as Thomas Braatz has explained, the Picander text is easily accessible and it is the linguistic parallels with the Trauer-Ode which has generally encoraged reconstructions leaning on that source.

     Melamed identifies five other related settings - Göttingen, Berlin (essentially the Reinhard Keiser/Brockes setting originating in Hamburg in 1707), and three other known versions which stem from J S Bach. Usually it is the 1731 version , which was composed separately from the others, that is referred to and performed as Bach's St Mark Passion.

     The rest form a chain of adaptation and pastiche originating in the Keiser Passion but scarcely recognisable as such by the end:

     The first, where parts have survived, dates from 1711-14 at Weimar.

     The second was adapted for Leipzig in 1726, with changes from the first; some of the vocal parts survive

     This version was further revised in the 1740's, for which a few performing parts remain . Four arias were replaced and three added, all seven of the new movements coming from G F Handel's Brockes Passion.

     Thus Bach's copying of Handel which started in Weimar continued throughout his career.

     In terms of lost documents Melamed, writing in 2005, makes the intriguing statement regarding the 1740's version:

     "A word is in order here about the evidence for this third version by Bach, known only by a very few performing parts prepared in the 1740's. There is reason to think these are escapees from a full set of parts that has survived
     into the twenty-first century but that it is closely held in private hands".

     It always struck me as odd that Bach would resuse a musical settting of a prose scriptural text for another prose text which would have entailed a lot of alteration. His usual practice was to substitute poetic texts which already fit the music. On the other hand, he successfully adapted German cantata poetry to the Latin prose of the masses, some might say he even improved the music in the case of the Agnus Dei of the B Minor Mass.

    Whittaker, 'The Cantatas of JSB', vol 1, pp 241-358, in what is called an Interlude, details Bach's borrowings.

    A wonderful section in a reference resource which is unfortunately not easy of access or readability, and hence is easily overlooked.

    As best I can see from a quick look, Whittaker does not deal with BWV 249 in this interlude.

    Dürr agrees with Thomas Braatz analysis of the parody nature of BWV 249. But then, why has Whittaker overlooked it? Dürr gives the first performance of BWV 249 as April 1, 1725, smack in the midst of the chronology we are now trying to follow .

    If this is accurate, it seems critically important to the nature of the music composed afresh, around these dates. If I have overlooked something and made a blunder, just point it out, I can cope. Otherwise, I think it is yet another BCML inspired MA thesis topic.

    The BWV lists two birthday cantatas (BWV 249a and BWV 249b) for which the music has been lost, but for some of the movements they at least have part of the text; and both of these reused movement 7 as follows:

    Feb 23 1725, for Herzog Christian von Sachsen-Weissenfels: mvt 7 "Wieget euch, ihr satten Schafe"

    August 25 1726, for Graf Joachim Friedrich von Flemming: mvt 7 "Senket euch nur ohne Kummer"

    =====

    In between those: April 1st 1752, the Easter oratorio (BWV 249) as the cantata "Kommt, fliehet und eilet" with a different 3rd movement...a tenor-bass duet there, instead of SATB, and with this different text.

    Later performances of BWV 249: "jeweils mit Aenderungen um 1738 und um 1743/46, ferner am 6.4.1749" [April 6 1749]

    To answer your first question: just get the BWV (catalog of Bach's works), flip it open, and look up stuff like this! It shows these types of interconnections among the pieces, and their different versions. This book:

    All interested should note the obvious correction, 1725, not 1752. The information from BWV is also reproduced in Dürr, although in a format which requires a little digging. I am writing because I previously indicated that I was surprised by the April 1, 1725 performance. I wrote in haste, without checking. In fact Wolff (B:LM) clearly indicates in his summary table, performances of both BWV 4 and BWV 249 on that date. This suggests that to get the full impact of Bach's chronology and creativity, we should consider BWV 249 along with the other new works we are discussing for the Easter season of 1725.

    Parody Texts

    Canyon Rick wrote (April 11, 2007):
    When Bach parodied his work,
    how did he find texts which matched the music he had already written? I'm thinking as an example, "Tonet, ihr Pauken" -->"Jauchzet, Frohlocket" (nomenclature of an old Deadhead :) )

    Did he just start going thru texts until, "Aha! This one will work."?
    Did he play the tune for Henrici and ask him to write a text that would fit?
    Or, were there "rules" (a la Meistersinger) that he could count on poets following, which would already make many poems/texts easily adaptable.

    I gather Bach did make musical alterations. But at what point does "simple modification" become "major re-write"? which I assume Bach wished to avoid.

    More than one movement of the B- Mass, including the Agnus Dei would, I think qualify as 'major re-writes'

    However as we are presently concerned with the second cycle you may, in this context,like to look at two works shortly to be introduced.

    Firstly the opening chorus of Cantata BWV 74 is wrought from a pre-existing duet. And two movements from Cantata BWV 68 have been parodied to quite different extents---the soprano aria (in which a new vocal line has been composed) and the bass aria which demonstrates the most subtle of re-writing in order to accommodate the new text.

    A close study of these three movements goes a long way towards answering your question, I think.


    Parodies, Posting & Empiricism

    Just a few brief words on recent threads:

    (1) Trying to figure the provenance and sequence of parodies is great for musicologists, but I think we're a little too quick to project our 'modern' standards of sacred vs. secular, sanctified vs. blasphemous onto Bach's attitude toward music. I don't think he really thought of music as either/or, nor did his contemporaries or predecessors (Missa l'homme armé etc). Even if he did, I'm not sure we'll ever know to what extent, given the available evidence. [OK, briefish...]

    (2) I don't post very often because (a) I don't feel I have much to contribute yet (read a couple books a while back...), (b) by the time I read/scroll through all the posts (via digest), everyone's far and away onto something else entirely (like now - I'm just catching up, & posting this at work on my lunch hour, a definite no-on), and (c) I'm a little apprehensive about starting another tempest in a teacup if someone takes offense at a poorly selected word (been there, done that on another list), or that by claiming that my time is limited I may be implying that everyone else on the list has no life outside the list.

    [Take a breath...]

    (3) In the same vein as (1), trying to ascertain Bach's religious and/or scientific beliefs (or lacks thereof) is also moot. Obviously they had an impact on what and how he wrote, but I again don't think we'll ever know to what extent. Certainly we won't solve the creation/evolution thing here either [didn't they legislate the answer

    I tend to agree with you that Bach would almost certainly not have catagorised music in the way that we do today. However is it not somewhat odd that in his parodies of (what we refer to as ) secular and religious music, the traffic seems to have gone pretty much one way only, too consistently to be coincidence? Pehaps this might indicate something attitudinal on Bach's part?

    And again agreed, we sure don't have the evidence to be certain of this--or much else about Bach's personal views for that matter!

    That's why it would be interesting to establish if there are two "streams" of parody in this cantata, one towards the sacred version and the other to the secular adaptations. A consistent procedure would support an aesthetic attitude for Bach.

    I agree totally that we have real difficulty in understanding Bach's compositional process. For instance, we have a strong modern attitude that "originality" is a hallmark of a great work of art and that "borrowing" is "plagiarism". And Bach is a conservative borrowed compared with Handel whose musical smash-and-grabs elicited contemporary comment!

    Given Bach's (and his contemporaries') fundamentally religious outlook on everything (however much that may pee off the atheists, myself included), I tend to agree. But what does that say about the strictly secular music Bach wrote? After all, music - the handmaid of theology - was a gift of God. How could it be specifically sacred or secular? On the other hand, a single instance or two of provenance won't provide much support for the hypothesis.

    I have heard 'contemporary' tunes that I believe were originally written in a religious context crop up in secular ones, to my surprise (everyone else seemed not to know what I was talking about). And vice versa. I can't say I wasn't surprised in both instances, given the customary hostility with which believers and non-believers seem to greet each others' pursuits. On the other hand, I remember many youthful hours at the piano with a hymn book (yes I did go to church in earlier years) fascinated with the secular tunes that had been drafted into worship services. I'd guess at least a third of its content comprised tunes that were originally secular (which particular brand of Christianity is not important, everybody did it).

    Culturally, we're light-years from Bach's time (and I say that without any value judgments); applying our criteria - religious, political, artistic - to his work doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

    A couple years ago Alain Bruguieres (note correct spelling, absent diacritical marks. I have missed the second u on many occasions, including a couple recently) and I exchanged thoughts on this topic.

    Alain concluded that pretty much all music originated in France as chansons damour (love songs). When they reached the German border, they were bowdlerized, cleaned up of sexual innuendo, and Luther used them for his chorales. I did not check the BCW archives this instant, but I know the material is there, including some specific examples. If anyone is interested and cannot find it, ask for help on list, it is on-topic.

    In for a dime, in for a dollar. If I get reprimanded for flaking off & inappropriate internet use, it's your fault. (Kidding.)

    I was thinking more about the nineteenth century when so many new flavours of Christian protestantism appeared, but with essentially the same result. I think I remember being told it was because the message was more effective if proselytes (proseltysees?) could participate with something familiar. Then again, I think that was Luther's rationale as well.

    Before the Sarabande gained respectability as one of the European suite's 'big four', I seem to recall hearing it was a little faster and a lot racier (oh, those Spanish...).

    The Zarabande (the original name for the dance) originated in South America actually! Here's Grove's entry on it:

    The earliest literary references to the zarabanda come from Latin America, the name firsappearing in a poem by Fernando Guzmán Mexía in a manuscript from Panama dated 1539, according to B.J. Gallardo (Ensayo de una biblioteca española de libros raros y curiosos, Madrid, 1888-9, iv, 1528). A zarabanda text by Pedro de Trejo was performed in 1569 in Mexico and Diego Durán mentioned the dance in his Historia de las Indias de Nueva-España (1579). The zarabanda was banned in Spain in 1583 for its extraordinary obscenity, but literary references to it continued throughout the early 17th century in the works of such writers as Cervantes and Lope de Vega. From about 1580 to 1610 it seems to have been the most popular of the wild and energetic Spanish bailes, superseded finally by the chacona (see Chaconne), with which it is frequently mentioned. The dance was accompanied by the guitar, castanets and possibly other percussion instruments, and by a text with refrain.

    Most surviving examples of the early zarabanda occur in Italian tablatures for the Spanish guitar, beginning in 1606 with Girolamo Montesardo's Nuova inventione d'intavolatura. Ex.1 shows a reconstruction of the musical scheme that would usually have been repeated for each line of the text, alternating with and without an anacrusis. The top staff shows the melodic framework, which could be varied, and the lower staff (from one of Montesardo's guitar examples) represents major triads to be strummed, the stems showing the direction in which the hand is to move. The refrain text comes from an example in Luis de Briçeño's Metodo mui facilissimo (Paris, 1626). The I-IV-I-V harmonic progression was a constant feature of the early zarabanda and can be found also in the later guitar books of Benedetto Sanseverino (see ex.2), G.A. Colonna (1620), Fabrizio Costanzo (1627), G.P. Foscarini (1629) and Antonio Carbonchi (1640 and 1643), as well as in the guitar works of Spanish composers as late as Lucas Ruiz de Ribayaz in 1677. Although the dance seems to have been performed without a text in Italy, the musical scheme of the zarabanda was sometimes indicated for the singing of poetry (in I-Fr 2774, 2793, 2804, 2849 and 2951).

    Marcel Gautreau wrote (January 24, 2009):

    "...The zarabanda was banned in Spain in 1583 for its extraordinary obscenity..."
    Thanks Kim. If something isn't selling, ban it or burn it. Maybe instead of dishing out billions (or trillions) to failing car corporations, we should just ban gasoline.

    "...Not a big deal, exactly, although the spiritual point the proposers of the hypothesis were trying to make was important to them, and is now discredited..."
    I can't agree the question is settled once for all (regardless of whatever motivation), at least not yet. Bach always espoused a goal of creating "a well-regulated church music" (I expect the original German is a lot more concise?), so he must have made some kind of distinction between sacred and secular music - just (probably) nothing like the kind of distinction we tend to make. Who knows, despite the effectiveness of the Passions, he might have flopped if he had to earn a living at opera. Until he apparently lost interest, he was able to crank out a huge volume of cantatas despite his other impossibly heavy obligations. Perhaps that had something to do with the fact that the recycling went on mostly in one direction?

    (I'm truly not trying to play devil's advocate for either side, I just think both have valid points. See, you've created a monster, I may never shut up. :)

    I not only nodded very much in agreement, but I felt moved to add something of a corollary. Bach was not big on writing out his beliefs and philosophy; on the whole, in verbal terms, he was rather laconic. Yet many now seem to be analyzing the recorded attitudes, beliefs, and practices of the people of Bach's time, even though we seem to recognize in other contexts that Bach was in many, many ways one of a kind, as he remains to this day.

    When he was pissed off, he was pissed off. Fairly often, as I read it. See the classic TNT sign-off, just for an example. You could argue that the beer [not the off-list Belgian Ale] put him over the edge. You could as easily argue, as I would, that the beer was his inspiration, and the tight-collared, humorless, Lutheran clerics were the source of his frustration. We have five years to discuss it, in a formal cycle.

    Harry, again (I hope I got it right):

    I would give those lengthy sentences another read, for clarity and content. I hate when I think I agree, except for the fact that I am not sure exactly what the other guy is saying. I would also give most of my sentences additional ed-and-Ed-itorial thought, if I thought they were headed for permanence.

    If the nugget in the middle [Bach was ..one of a kind] is meant to say that Bach was a unique genius, I agree 100%. Clear out the surrounding clutter. The same guy who taught me, almost exactly fifty years ago, to chop out every word was not carrying its own weight, and who encouraged me to make a living as an engineer and write peotry on the side, rather than trying to be a professional poet (how naive could I have been?!) ...sentence peters out, without formal closure.

    The one secular song Luther borrowed was from a popular pre-Reformation (not a drinking tune!) secular song, "I Arrived from an Alien Country," and was used as the melody for the Christmas hymn, "From Heaven on High I Come to You", the first stanza Luther patterned after the folk song. (source: Robert D. Harrell, Martin Luther, His Music, His Message, p. 18)

    Somewhere I read that Luther later changed this tune to some extent.

    And don't forget, as church historians well know, that Luther (and Bach) lived in the "Age of Faith", not the Age of Scepticism".

    Is not the phrase Age of Science (i.e. the scientific method) more accurate than Age of Scepricism? In the words of Jesus (concise version) Seek and ye shall find. For the preferred Gospel of Thomas language, see my post the other day.

    In order to avoid creating an additional post, and in the process, pissing off the folks who wish to be pissed off even more so: an Ellington and Bach addendum, I fogot to write:

    Mozart said words to the effect, <I want the clarinets>. Ellington delivered. Perhaps Mozart was speaking to him, or through him?

    I beg to differ.
    Science does not oppose faith. Scepticism does.
    Besides, "Age of Faith" versus "Age of Scepticism" is acepted terminology in church history.

    Provenance & Sarabande: Fugitive Thoughts

    Thank you, Thomas Braatz, for another exemplary Provenance contribution.

    Now, we are exploring the great connections between Bach's vocal and instrumental music, all part of
    one great tapestry. Thank God for these marvelous reconstructions, especially his "Arioso" and the
    slow movement of the Double Concerto for violin and oboe. There was a time when Bach scholarship
    suffered from what I call Theodore Adorno's 11th and 12th Musical Commandments: "Thou shalt not
    tamper with the Master" (reconstruction or realization) and "The Master shall not tamper with
    Himself" (parody or transformation).

    As for the Sarabande, the great closing chorus in the St. Matthew Passion in 3/4 time is such. It
    could have originated in the watershed period of Lent 1725 with Picander's Poetic Passion libretto
    closing Chorus of the Faithful: "Wir setzen uns bei deinem Grabe nieder." I also believe that this
    monumental chorus could be Bach's summary of Ecclesiastes 3:4 (not 3/4) "A time to weep and a time
    to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance;"

    Bach's Partita N.2 in C Minor (BWV 826) and any of his Cantatas - Query

    Aryeh Oron wrote (May 7, 2010):

    I received the message below from Pablo Castro Off-List:

    =============
    I was visiting your site about Bach Cantatas, and I
    wanted to know if you have any information about a possible relation between Bach's Partita N.2 in C
    Minor (BWV 826) and any of his Cantatas. Specifically if there's any use that Bach have made of the
    first part of the Partita, the Sinfonia, in any of his Cantatas.

    That's all for now and congratulations for your very interesting and informing site on Bach.
    ==============

    Any answer regarding this query would be most appreciated.

    Julian Mincham wrote (May 7, 2010): [To Aryeh Oron] In my study of the cantatas I haven't noticed
    any direct references to the partita. In fact Bach did not generally seem to make use of his
    keyboard music (other than the concertos) in the cantata canon. I am sure that there is no
    paraphrase of it although the imperious dotted note introduction might find echos in some of the
    minor mode French Overtures.

    William Hoffman wrote (May 7, 2010):
    [To Aryeh Oron] William Hoffman replies:

    The tri-parte Italianate instrumental sinfonia in c minor, opening BWV 826 was never intended to be
    orchestrated as a cantata sinfonia. Most of the some 30 were either original or transcriptions from
    concerto movements.The Sinfonia in question probably was composed in the second half of 1725, when
    Bach took a hiatus from weekly sacred cantata composition to start the Anna Magdalena notebook and
    the keyboard Partitas to become the Clavier UIebung I publication (Opus 1). Each of the six partitas
    has a special non-dance introduction: Praeludium, Sinfonia, Fantasia, Praeambulum, Overture, and
    Tocatta, followed by a suite of dances.
