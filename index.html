<p>
Konzentration
</p>

<p>
G√∂nnen Sie Ihrem Gehirn eine Pause
Das Gehirn erholt sich im Schlaf. Klar. Aber nicht nur. Auch im Wachzustand sind regelm√§ssige Pausen wichtig.
</p>

<p>
Regelm√§ssige Pausen sind keine verlorene Zeit.
Regelm√§ssige Pausen sind keine verlorene Zeit.
¬© Petra Grau / pixelio.de
Wer geistig √ºber l√§ngere Zeit unter Strom steht, sollte immer wieder kleine oder auch l√§ngere Erholungsphasen einbauen. Das ist kein unn√∂tiger Zeitverlust, im Gegenteil. Nichtstun ist eine wichtige Voraussetzung f√ºr Kreativit√§t und Produktivit√§t. Wer sein Potential nutzen will, muss ausruhen, die Gedanken schweifen lassen. Nur g√∂nnen die Menschen sich viel zu wenige Pausen.
</p>

<p>
Kreativit√§tsforscher Ernst P√∂ppel, Chef des M√ºnchner Instituts f√ºr Medizinische Psychologie (IMP), spricht gar von einem ¬´Kreativit√§tsstau¬ª. P√∂ppel ist √ºberzeugt, dass unsere Gesellschaft ¬´geradezu explodieren k√∂nnte, wenn alle t√§glich eine Stunde aus dem Kommunikationszwang aussteigen w√ºrden¬ª.
</p>

<p>
Mach mal Pause!
Folgende Arten von Pausen haben sich f√ºr Studierende bew√§hrt. In angepasster Form haben sie auch im Arbeitsprozess G√ºltigkeit:
</p>

<p>
Kurze Gedankenpausen/Verschnaufpausen: Damit k√∂nnen Sie Gelerntes abschliessen und die Verarbeitungsprozesse im Gehirn fangen an.
Minipausen: 5 Minuten alle 30 Minuten: kurz aufzustehen, einige Bewegungs√ºbungen machen.
Kurzpausen: Sp√§testens nach 2 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie 15 bis 20 Minuten Pause machen. Tun Sie nichts ausser etwas trinken und vielleicht etwas (leichtes) essen.
Freizeitpausen: Nach 3 bis 4 Stunden lernen/arbeiten sollten Sie sich 1 bis 2 Stunden lang erholen und diese freie Zeit bewusst geniessen.

Wundermittel Schlaf
Das wichtigste f√ºr ein leistungsf√§higes Gehirn ist die regelm√§ssige Nachtruhe. Das Gehirn nutzt und braucht den Schlaf, um zu verarbeiten, was es tags√ºber geleistet hat. Mehr noch. Viele Probleme l√∂sen sich geradezu √ºber Nacht. Viele Menschen kommen beim Aufwachen oft auf L√∂sungen, die ihm am Vortag noch unl√∂sbar schienen. Schlafforscher erkl√§ren das Ph√§nomen so: Der Schlaf dient dazu, √ºberfl√ºssige Nervenverkn√ºpfungen abzubauen und neue zu festigen. Im Schlaf √ºberf√ºhrt das Gehirn zudem neue Informationen vom Zwischenspeicher ins Langzeitged√§chtnis verankert sie da.
</p>

<p>
Sport treiben und gesund essen
Das Gehirn kann sich aber auch aktiv erholen. Sport kann Ihnen helfen, Ihre Konzentration zu verbessern. Denn Sport kurbelt nicht nur den Stoffwechsel an, sondern verbessert auch die Sauerstoffzufuhr, was der Konzentrationsf√§higkeit dient.
</p>

<p>
Wichtig f√ºr das Gehirn ist auch eine gesunde Ern√§hrung. Am besten sind f√ºnf kleinere Mahlzeiten regelm√§ssig √ºber den Tag verteilt. So bleibt Ihr Blutzuckerspiegel stabil. Denn ein tiefer Blutzuckerspielge f√ºhrt zu Konzentrationsmangel und Leistungsabfall. Nebst gen√ºgend Kohlenhydraten, Eiweiss, Vitaminen und pflanzlichen unges√§ttigten Fetten braucht das Gehirn aber auch gen√ºgend Fl√ºssigkeit wie Wasser, unges√ºssten Tee oder verd√ºnnte Fruchts√§fte. Lebensmittel, die besonders gut f√ºr Ihr Gehirn sind, finden Sie auf dem Merkblatt ¬´Brainfood¬ª.
</p>

<p>
Nahrungserg√§nzungsmittel
Aufbau- und Vitaminpr√§parate sind eine sinnvolle Erg√§nzung zur ausgewogenen Ern√§hrung. Vor allem, wenn beispielsweise nach einer Krankheit ein erh√∂hter Bedarf an Mineralien, Vitaminen und Spurenelementen besteht.

Vitamine: Vitamin C kann stimulieren. Die B-Vitamine unterst√ºtzen die Funktion des Nervensystems und setzen Energie aus Kohlenhydraten frei, die es f√ºr die korrekte Funktion der Hirnzellen braucht.
Pflanzliche Stoffe: Ginseng oder Ginkgo biloba k√∂nnen die Konzentration verbessern, indem sie die Durchblutung der Hirnzellen f√∂rdern. Bestimmte Lebensmittel respektive Gew√ºrze wie Knoblauch, Zwiebeln, Kohl oder Cayennepfeffer f√∂rdern ebenfalls die Durchblutung.
Kaffee, Guarana und Cola wirken wegen ihres Koffeingehaltes stimulierend.

Marcel Duchamp by Man Ray (1920) &amp; Etoile cosmique (1923) by Raymond Roussel
</p>

<p>
¬´ My soul is a strange factory ¬ª -Raymond Roussel
</p>

<p>
New Impressions of Raymond Roussel points us towards an intellectual history that maps out art‚Äôs role in creating a social allegory for the poetic psychoanalysis<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> of mechanized pleasure ‚Äì in circular struggle with the mechanized mass killings of World War I and II, the holocaust, and Hiroshima. And the rewards of such exhausting circularity are considerable, given both the historical significance of Raymond Roussel‚Äôs influence and its unapologetic relevance to today‚Äôs cyber culture ‚Äì with its intransigent obliqueness and mechanical dizziness.
</p>

<p>
But if I were going to generate an art exhibition as homage to a particularly flamboyant artist,<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> even if un peu obscur, I would think that it would be advantageous to try to match the aesthetic qualities of that person (absurdly intricate mechanical interlacings) with the show‚Äôs general aesthetic. Unfortunately, that was not the least bit achieved with the homage to the wildly creative dandy writer Raymond Roussel (1877-1933)<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> that is at the Palais de Tokyo centre d‚Äôart contemporain in Paris.
</p>

<p>
While access to much of the remarkable work here (including five of Roussel‚Äôs otherworldy hand written manuscript pages for his last book Comment j‚Äôai √©crit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books) and a wonderful cookie-encasing sculpture memento called Etoile cosmique (Cosmic Star) ‚Äì a glass and silver case that Roussel had made for a star-shaped biscuit he brought back from lunch in Juvisy-sur-Orge with the astronomer Camille Flammarion (1842-1925) on July 29, 1923) is to be appreciated and relished, the cavernous half-finished Level 1 Galerie Seine devoured and neutralized any stylistic moods of gamesmanship that are associated with Roussel: such as the famously extravagant, yet intricately hermetic, elaborate mechanamorphic constructions that verged on the exuberantly preposterousness of a machine running infinitely wild. Perhaps if I had seen the other two manifestations of this show ‚Äì Impressions of Raymond Roussel held at the Museo Reina Sofia (Madrid) in 2011 and the Museu Serralves (Porto) in 2012 ‚Äì I may not have felt so disappointed in the general lack of neurotic deliriousness experienced in this one.
</p>

<p>
Granted that Raymond Roussel‚Äôs disregard for financial restraint<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> cannot be matched by the Palais de Tokyo, but still the gutted construction materials hanging overhead in this ugly cavernous space takes the eye and mind out of the magnificently intricate labyrinthine quality typical of his extravagant writings: as established in the prose work Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique (1910) (a work that features a painting machine that duplicates the color spectrum of the sky at dawn),<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup> Locus Solus (1914) (like Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique, written according to formal constraints based on homonymic puns) and the obsessive but convulsingly poetic Nouvelle Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique (1932).<sup><a id="fnr.6" name="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> Thus the larger the art (even as it was needed to fill this mammoth half-raw space) the worse it connected to Roussel‚Äôs sense of virtual impenetrability through mechanical precision.
</p>

<p>
Mike Kelly‚Äôs lumbering black cave Kandors 10B (Exploded Fortress of Solitude) (2011) and Rodney Graham‚Äôs Camera Obscura Mobile (1995-1996) installation were particularly unmatched to Roussel‚Äôs obsessive minute attention; a concentration that is capable of whirling together copious narratives from a veiled network of murky puns and obscured double entendres in a way that anticipates Oulipian. Mark Manders‚Äôs steamy black connectivist sculpture Mind Study (2011), Giuseppe Gabellone‚Äôs beautiful silver sculpture L‚ÄôAssetalo (Thirsty Man) (2008) and Jacques Carelman‚Äôs droll motion sculpture Le Diamont (The Dimond) (1975) worked only a bit better in reinforcing a spirit of intricate mechanicalness as they each ate up almost an entire room. A relatively fascinating installation by Andr√© Maranha, Pedro Morais, Jorge Queiroz and Francisco Tropa called Tres Moscas (Three Flies) (2012) did eat an entire room and only delivered limited thematic power in terms of absurd interlacing.
</p>

<p>
Much more capable of such finicky and arcane mesmerizing rhythms was the more intimate yet preposterous work of Thomas Bayrle (his deadpan pulsating romantic machine Spatz von Paris (2011) is one of the highlights of the show). Rodney Graham‚Äôs series of books called The System worked well in the context and it was captivating to see displays of the literary journal Revue Locus Solus, established by American writers John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, Kenneth Koch and James Shuyler. Published in Paris between 1961 and 1962, the journal formed a bridge between French authors, both historical and contemporary, and writers from the New York School and the Beat Generation. The Coll√®ge de Pataphysique was represented by the writer Jean Ferry who published several studies devoted to Roussel, including L‚ÄôAfrique des Impressions, a detailed analysis which consists of considering the text as instructions for users and reconstructing, in the form of maps, diagrams and schedules, the journeys and events that took place at Ponuk√©l√©, an imaginary place in Roussel‚Äôs Africa. Two comical cosmic Joseph Cornell boxes, Blue Sand Box and Sand Fountain from the early 1950s pleased me, as they bracketed a stream of photographed drawings of fantastic imaginary architecture from 1857 by Victorien Sardou ‚Äì as did an early Pataphysical video by Jean-Christophe Averty. The irascible Salvador Dal√≠ is represented with his short motion picture Impressions de la Haute Mongolie (1975), made with the filmmaker Jos√© Montes-Baquer. Dal√≠ read Roussel‚Äôs books as early as the 1920s and Roussel had a great influence on Dal√≠‚Äôs ‚Äúcritical paranoia‚Äù method. Dal√≠, who died with a copy of Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique on his bedside table, believed him to be one of France‚Äôs greatest writers ever. Jean Tinguely is inserted, rightly, into this mix with a brain-teasing manic lithograph from 1966-67 called Requiem pour une feuille morte (Requiem for a Dead Leaf), rather than an expected endless drawing machine contraption, that would have more directly interlocked with Roussel‚Äôs imagined painting machine.
</p>

<p>
And Roussel‚Äôs major inspiration (along with novelist and naval officer Pierre Loti), the author Jules Verne, has a wacky lithograph of a flat globe studded with images entitled Around the World in Eighty Days from 1880. Roussel greatly admired the works of Verne ‚Äì which he read over and over again, fascinated with their extraodinary voyages and machines, full of bachelor scientists completely absorbed in positivist exploratory dreams taken to delirious extremes. At that scale of interlacing, some of the hypnotic effect of Roussel‚Äôs capacious playful circularity is possible to feel.
</p>

<p>
However, Gabriele Di Matteo‚Äôs contribution to the show‚Äôs circularity is essential. His hand-painted over digital-painting Marcel Duchamp, a life in pictures by Andr√© Raffray illustrates the time when Duchamp attended a showing of Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique in 1912, an experience Duchamp would describe as revelatory. As Gabriele Di Matteo depicts, Duchamp, along with Guillaume Appollinaire, Picabia and Picabia‚Äôs wife Gabrielle Buffet, attended a performance of Impressions of Africa: the play by Roussel based on his book. Duchamp later credited Roussel with the inspiration for his The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass). There are several original notes by Duchamp and a drawing that he made for The Large Glass in 1912-1915 in the show, as well as quite a few photos of Duchamp with The Large Glass. Among them is the striking photo of Duchamp that was taken by Man Ray in 1920 that shows a star carved out in Duchamp‚Äôs hair. This work connects ludicrously well with Roussel‚Äôs star shaped cookie piece, Etoile cosmique, from just three years later.
</p>

<p>
Historically, the mechanamorphic impulse behind Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs works from 1912 (that derived a good deal from Roussel) is of great significance. That is when Duchamp started producing paintings and drawings depicting mechanized sex acts such as Mechanics of Modesty and The Passage from the Virgin to the Bride ‚Äì and the fantastic machine-body work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even that follow his exposure to the play Impressions d‚ÄôAfrique ‚Äì is an inescapable point of reference for the avant-garde of the 20th century. The same may be said for Francis Picabia (who has a room of paintings all to himself at the show La Collection Michael Werner just a stone throw away at the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt Moderne Ville de Paris).
</p>

<p>
The elaborateness of the machine, for Duchamp and Picabia, became the symbol of sexual bliss<sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> attainable through concept connected to auto-sexual autonomy in contradiction to the horror that mechanized war had brought. By hypnotizing attention, the machine freed them from troubling obsessions and personal hang-ups through the alternative model of android life; intimating both our rush of desperation and our ecstatic release, refracted through a web of glazed impersonality. If the machine, as a representative of order, was a fascination Duchamp and Picabia used to balance out the age‚Äôs clumsiness, whether of the mind or flesh, Roussel‚Äôs mechanamorphic production and machine forms refigured the human body into an almost mechanized substance.
</p>

<p>
In The Bride Stripped Bare by the Bachelors, Even, which positions a central bride machine over a bachelor apparatus, Duchamp, with the strictness of machinery, applies fantasy to seduction and masturbation. In a way, Duchamp suggests that we (as viewers) can use his art as a vehicle for self-transcendence into a kind of dream world of nonsense sex. This rabbit-hole logic he took from Roussel.
</p>

<p>
So New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it outlines an eccentric expanding circular history of 20th-century art, linking the points between artists and writers who have talked of the influence of this author and his writings on their work: starting with Dada (Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabia), then Andr√© Breton and the Surrealists (like Michel Leiris, Salvador Dal√≠, Jean Cocteau) to Neo-Dada Nouveau r√©alisme (Jean Tinguely) through Oulipo (Georges Perec) Pataphysicians (Jean Ferry, Jean-Christophe Averty and the Coll√®ge de Pataphysique) and the authors of the nouveau roman (like Alain Robbe-Grillet). As noted above, his most direct influence in the English-speaking world was on the New York School of poets John Ashbery, Harry Mathews, James Schuyler, and Kenneth Koch.
</p>

<p>
Writing as art ‚Äì or ‚Äì art as writing: this is the theoretical ripe fruit plucked from Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel ‚Äì art theory as art ‚Äì made conceivable by Roussel‚Äôs inventions of language machines that produced texts through the use of repetitions and combination/permutations. This machine-like logic provides art with a seemingly pure spectacle of endless variety of textual games and combinations flowing in circular form. (We see and feel this most fully, however, in the sprawling and dazzling Julio Le Parc kinetic op art retrospective on the first floor of the Palais de Tokyo, rather than in this show.)
</p>

<p>
And there are lessons here for painting, also. Within this writing process Roussel described a number of fantastic machines, including a painting machine in his novel Impressions of Africa. This painting machine wonderfully describes and foresees the arrival of computer-robotic technology and it‚Äôs application to visual art which we have available to us today, a century after he envisioned it.
</p>

<p>
The web also regenerates deep connections to the past; so cyberspace, this territory which stretches out from hypertext to the world-wide computer network, from virtual reality to video games, might also be theorized as the domain of Roussel‚Äôs idea of reduplicating without duplication, reiterating without repeating: his game-of-mirrors cosmos. His is a strident activity lost in an infinite navigation from one sort of encounter to another in which the affirmation of the other keeps appearing and disappearing in the play of mechanical maneuvers (or mechanisms) destined to avert gratification. This is where the bachelor apparatus of Duchamp repeats itself ad infinitum by transmitting the machine via an alter-ego.
</p>

<p>
But too, New Impressions of Raymond Roussel reminds us that Raymond Roussel‚Äôs themes and procedures also involved imprisonment and liberation, exoticism, cryptograms and torture by language ‚Äì all formally reflected in his working technique with its inextricable play of double images, repetitions, and impediments, all giving the impression of the pen running on by itself through the dreamy usage and baroque play of mirrored form.
</p>

<p>
Roussel‚Äôs running on repetition technique, as used in the Thomas Bayrle sculpture, for example, lends itself well to the creation of unforeseen, automatic and spontaneously art which gives me the feeling of prolonging action into eternity through the ceaseless, fantastic constructions of the work itself, transmitting an altered, exalted and orgasmic state of mind which after the initial dazzling creates one predominant overall effect: that of creating doubt through mechanical discourse.
</p>

<p>
The image of enclosure is common with Roussel where a secret to a secret is held back, systematically imposing a formless anxiety in the reader through the labyrinthine extensions and doublings, disguises and duplications of his texts, which make all speech and vision undergo a moment of annihilation.
</p>

<p>
New Impressions of Raymond Roussel succeeds when it presents to us through intimacy the model of quiet perfection of the eternally repetitive mechanical machine which functions independently of time and space, pulling us into a logic of the infinite. We can learn this from Roussel‚Äôs final rebus-like book, Comment j‚Äôai √©crit certains de mes livres (How I Wrote Certain of my Books); the last of his conceptual machines, the machine which contains and repeats within its mechanism all those mental machines he had formerly described and put into motion, making evident the machine which produced all of his machines ‚Äì the master machine.<sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> All of these machines map out an eccentric spiral space that is circular in nature and thus an abstract attempt at eliminating time. They reproduce the old myths of departure, of loss and of return. They construct a crisscrossed mechanical map of the two great mythic spaces so often explored by western imagination: space that is rigid and forbidden, containing the quest, the return and the treasure (for example the geography of the Argonauts and the labyrinth) ‚Äì and the other space of polymorphosis noise: the visible transformation of instantly crossed frontiers and borders, of strange affiliations, of spells, and of symbolic replacements (the space of the Minotaur).
</p>

<p>
Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel potentially removes us out of our quiet and glib indolence and points us in the potent direction of expanding intensity. I believe that shows like Nouvelles impressions de Raymond Roussel are critical to us now because the counter-mannerist excess found there may problematize the popular simulacra that art has become ‚Äì and make the underground intricately-strange privateness of the human animal more lively.

One Response to Review of Nouvelles Impressions de Raymond Roussel
G. W. Smith says:
April 14, 2013 at 11:12 pm
The appearance of Joseph Nechvatal‚Äôs byline in On-Verge, is, in one sense, paradoxical, for Dr. Nechvatal is by no means an emerging writer; indeed, he has had perhaps more of value to say, in scores of books and articles, than any other art theorist regarding the the survival of the thinking, breathing ‚Äî and loving ‚Äî individual within our modern technological matrix. This is amply demonstrated in the current review, of a show dedicated to one of those wonderful French intellectuals, Raymond Roussel, whose writings not only helped his fellow Europeans survive the mechanized horrors of the early twentieth century, but which also ‚Äî through a type of verbal jujitsu ‚Äî allowed them to retain their own hold on the indispensable machine ‚Äî this to the great benefit of his followers including Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, and Jean Tinguely.
</p>

<p>
If, however, we take ‚ÄúOn-Verge‚Äù to refer also to the dawn of a new post-postModernist age ‚Äî in which the vitality and precision of technology is married to a humanistic sensibility ‚Äî then the appearance of Dr. Nechvatal‚Äôs review is both appropriate ‚Äî and welcomed.

Hi Eric,
thanks for the tip. I tried this already. Its printing but has some drawbacks. E.g. I use high resolution monitors in vertical (pivot) mode and a tiling window manager. calfw scales to the current buffer size and this is unfortunately not really compatible with printing. In summary this solution might have to many ways to go wrong.
</p>

<p>
However, I noticed a much more interesting way. calfw buffer look almost like org-tables. And voila saving the buffer as org-file and a minimum of modifications allows me to export the calendar with both the html and pdf exporter. I just try to tell org-mode/latex/html to keep the height of the rows constant and independent of the content of the cell. Guess if I get this right, everything could be done in a little piece of elisp.
Alternatively, Sakurai san may like to create an official cfw:export-view-to-org could be part of calfw-org. This would also allow people to archive calendar views in org-mode files.

Much of my pure syntactic research over the past few years is consolidated in Provocative Syntax. I'm continuing on with my investigations in this model of morphosyntax. Doug Wharram and I have begun to study how syntactic "provocation" and semantics interact in the interpretation of Inuktitut indefinites.
</p>

<p>
I've also published work on the nature of ergativity (with Jonathan Bobaljik) and on quotative inversion (with Chris Collins).

With the possible exception of artists and architects, no one is more full of shit than designers. We can find a way to justify anything. Blah blah blah. That means no matter what you end up with, you can come up with some reason why it‚Äôs a good design. The best advice I have for designers is to practice being not-designers: stop what you‚Äôre doing, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths and then look again like you‚Äôre just a regular person encountering this product/service/user interface/object/page/poster for the first time. Where do your eyes go? What do you think it is at first? How do you figure out what you are supposed to do?

There is some truth to that old Henry Ford aphorism ‚ÄúWhether you think you can, or you think you can‚Äôt‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou‚Äôre right.‚Äù. If you can‚Äôt believe it, it‚Äôs probably not going to happen. However, I like to take that one step further and ensure that every action we take is one that assumes the desired outcome is inevitable. Do not make actions that are out of alignment with that inevitability. Do not allow judgements which contradict it. The more evidence you have‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand everyone else has‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat things will come out as planned, the more likely it will be so.

When I was around 10 or 11 years old, my father offered me $10 to move a cord of recently-delivered firewood from the driveway into the garage and stack it up inside (I am old; $10 was a great deal of money back then). I managed to get all the firewood inside but rather than it being stacked against the wall, it was more or less evenly distributed across the floor of the garage. I expected my payment, but instead got some advice: ‚ÄúEvery job you do has your signature on it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädo you really want to sign that?‚Äù I always remembered that and if I am going to do something, I make every effort to do it right. (I also properly stacked the wood afterwards, even though it took forever, and I got paid in the end.)

I used to play in a band. Other people might have played team sports, or worked in a well-functioning restaurant. There‚Äôs something about working deeply, in real-time, with other people that‚Äôs both incredibly satisfying and enormously more effective than working alone. You need to be open for the pass, you need to hear the subtle rhythm shifts, you need to spot when someone else‚Äôs table needs the check ‚Ä¶ everyone should be taking account of what everyone else is doing and constantly modifying their own behaviour to better serve the team.

If you are just out to make money, god bless: I hope you make some money. If you just want awards or recognition or for others to think highly of you, I hope you get that too. But I don‚Äôt think anyone is really satisfied by fame or fortune. I find it incredibly satisfying (and gratifying, rewarding and pleasant) to honestly have done the best job I could have done on something and I believe that works for everyone else too. Being skillful and exercising your mastery is what you‚Äôre here to do. Doing anything less undermines the whole point of being alive.

EMPAC Research: A New Paradigm for Interactive Exploration of Data with Live Coding
from EMPAC @ Rensselaer PLUS  1 year ago / Creative Commons License: by sa  ALL AUDIENCES
</p>

<p>
Part 1: Exploring a Dark Data Set ( 13 min. )
</p>

<p>
Part 2: The Field Environment ( 10 min. )
</p>

<p>
Interactive data exploration - as opposed to documentation of research outcomes - requires a hard- and software environment that allows quick turn-around (as in live coding), accelerated graphics processing and projection (utilizing GPUs for data processing), an ‚Äúagnostic‚Äù parsing of data, and the ability to tap into the endless existing libraries available on-line. This approach allows quick access to and navigation of ‚Äúbig data‚Äù.
</p>

<p>
The open-source software Field programming environment provides all of the above. It allows to quickly manipulate different representations of a given data set, to navigate representation interactively, to create animations and to discover new perspectives.
</p>

<p>
Mathematical processes applied to the data can be changed as quickly as the mapping in the visual domain. Other modalities of representation, like stereoscopic visual representation, immersive projections or auditory mapping can easily be accessed.
</p>

<p>
This video shows in its first part the exploration of a ‚Äúdark data set‚Äù, where the source and desired evaluation of the data was not known to the researcher visualizing the data. It turned out to be the simulation output of a high-performance computing network topology (‚ÄúDragon Fly Network‚Äù). Immediately insights into the data were unfolding and allowed to discover properties in the simulation, which had gone unnoticed before.
</p>

<p>
The second part presents an overview over the Field environment.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Celebrating Einstein strives to communicate all of this beauty and excitement to the general public by bridging the gap between the sciences and the arts in both its design and end products. This event is a truly collaborative and interdisciplinary effort between the departments of physics, history, communication, music, film, photography, art, and architecture at Montana State University, Princeton University, and UCLA. These many different fields all use creativity to invent new ideas that deepen our understanding of the world. Einstein's iconic figure, the centennial of the discovery of his most important theory, and the imminent direct detection of his final prediction produce a perfect theme for Celebrating Einstein.
</p>

<p>
Celebrating Einstein includes several events: a public lecture series by world-renowned scientists, including University of Maryland's Jim Gates, recipient of the National Medal of Science and member of the President's Science Advisory Panel, and David Kaiser, a best-selling author and the head of the MIT Program in Science, Technology and Society; Celebrating Einstein in the Schools, a collection of K-12 classroom lessons and activities; the Black (W)hole art installation, featuring visualizations and sounds of a small black hole spiraling violently into a supermassive one; and the Shout Across Time live multimedia theatre show, which will feature a dance-company performance illustrating a lecture on general relativity, a live orchestra, playing an original composition inspired by gravitational waves, and an original film featuring numerical simulations of black hole collisions.

This gymnasium was created from an existing sports facility situated in M√£e Luiza, a favela in Natal, north-east Brazil. It now contains a sports field with tiered seating for 420 people, multipurpose rooms for dance and education, a terrace with ocean views, as well as changing rooms and public restrooms. The building's standout feature is its generous roof, which is constructed to allow light and air in but keep water out, giving a new civic place visible from afar. The two ends of the elongated pitched roof open up towards the neighbourhood and invite people in.

<p>
Also called the Garden School, this building is part of a larger scheme to build a healthier and self-sustainable new town just outside Beijing. The desire to create more open spaces filled with nature, combined with the space limitations of the site, inspired a strategy on the vertical dimension, creating multiple grounds by separating the programs into above and below, and inserting gardens in-between. The roof-top of the upper building is designed to be an organic farm, with 36 plots - one for each class in the school, providing students the chance to learn the techniques of farming, and also paying tribute to the site's pastoral past.

House for Trees, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam ‚Äì Vo Trong Nghia Architects
</p>

<p>
Under rapid urbanization, cities in Vietnam have diverged far from their origins as sprawling tropical forests. An over-abundance of motorbikes causes daily traffic congestion as well as serious air pollution. House for Trees is an effort to change this situation. The aim is to bring green back into the city, accommodating high-density dwelling with big tropical trees. Five concrete boxes are designed as 'pots' to plant trees on their tops. With thick soil layer, these pots also function as storm-water basins for retention, therefore contribute to reduce the risk of flooding when the idea is multiplied to a large number of houses in the future.

La √öltima Esperanza is the final iteration of a long-term collaboration between AL BORDE and the Cabuyal community which has already produced a school and a community centre. This project saw the architects design not a building, but system for teaching architecture so that the community can become more self-sufficient, developing their own methodology of design, and ultimately creating their own buildings.

Located in the center of Rotterdam, Markthal is the first covered food market of the Netherlands. Each of the 228 apartments has a view either towards the historic Laurenskwartier, and towards the market through windows or a glass floor made of sound and smell proof triple glazing. The open sides of the Markthal closed to prevent rain and cold from entering, was designed to be as transparent as possible by opting for a single glazed cable net fa√ßade. The mural 'Cornucopia' by artists Arno Coenen and Iris Roskam has a surface of 11.000 m2. 'Cornucopia' shows oversized images of market produce available at the market, while the flowers and insects refer to the work of Dutch still life masters from the 17th century. The image was printed onto perforated aluminum panels, and then attached to acoustic panels for noise control.

The new Philharmonic Hall of Szczecin is located on the historical site of the 'Konzerthaus', which was destroyed during Second World War and recomposes an urban corner in a neighbourhood near to the historic city. The building houses a symphony hall for 1000 spectators, a hall for chamber music, a multifunctional space for exhibitions and conferences, and a wide foyer, which can also be used to host events. The hall is composed following a Fibonacci sequence whose fragmentation increases with the distance from the scene, and gives shape to an ornamental space whose gold-leaf covering calls to mind the classical tradition.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-2-1-12-3-1-12">
<p>
Inspired by the fact that a mosque does not have a predefined form and anywhere clean may be a prayer room, this project focused on the 'essence' of a religious space, distancing itself from discussions based on form. The design aimed at representing purest forms of light and matter, just as a primary inner world, free from all cultural burdens. The disappearance of the building in to the slope of the site, anchored to the ground, creates the sense that it has always been a part of this landscape.

<p>
The site specific sculptural concept for this design is tailored in response to specific lines of sight along approaching vistas, from street corner perspectives and to make visual connections between internal and external circulation. The surface of the brick skin is cut out along fold lines to form large areas of glazing, framing views from street to room. The design is assembled to make one coherent volume from a complex set of component parts. The building is clad with bricks, used in a new way, with each brick offset from the next in an open work pattern, wrapping the walls in a permeable blanket, creating dappled daylight inside and glowing like a lattice lantern at night.

Santiago's weather inspired the architects to substitute the contemporary typical glass skin, responsible for serious greenhouse effect in interiors, for a thermal mass on the perimeter that avoids undesired heat gains. Open air squares are multiplied throughout the building's entire height and a permeable atrium core is proposed so that while circulating vertically, people could see what others are doing. As well as creating the right environment for knowledge-creation, this design has reduced energy costs by two-thirds.

Shadowing was first commissioned by Watershed as the winner of the 2014 Playable City Award and was installed in eight locations across Bristol during September and October 2014.

Calling itself 'the largest clean up in history', this project aims to develop environmentally friendly, large-scale, and efficient removal of plastic pollution from aquatic ecosystems. Founded by Dutch environmentalist Boyan Slat after he encountered more plastic bags than fish while diving in Greece at the age of 16, the proposal takes the form of a network of floating barriers which cause natural currents to push plastics towards a central platform, allowing for efficient extraction and storage of concentrated plastic for transportation to land. The Ocean Cleanup recently raised over US$2 million through a crowd funding campaign, which the organisation plans to use for the construction and testing of large-scale operational pilots.

The Refugee Project is an interactive map that uses UNHCR refugee data and UN population data to tell the histories of refugee movements over time from 1975 to 2012. The map visualizes the size of refugee diasporas from dozens of unstable or repressive nations each year. The Refugee Project also includes over 80 stories that give political and historical context to the major refugee crises of each year. By shedding light on these global patterns, the makers hope to empower aid workers, governments, academics and citizens to seek compassionate solutions for some of the most vulnerable populations on earth.

Designing for the Sixth Extinction ‚Äì Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg
</p>

<p>
Commissioned by Science Gallery, Dublin, Designing for the Sixth Extinction investigates synthetic biology's potential impact on biodiversity and conservation. The project imagines a future in which new companion species designed by synthetic biologists support endangered natural species and ecosystems. Modeled on fungus, bacteria, invertebrates and mammals, the designed species are ecological machines that fill the void left by vanished organisms, or offer novel protection against more harmful invasive species, diseases and pollution. But are they even 'alive'? If nature is totally industrialized for the benefit of society‚Äîwhich for some is the logical endpoint of synthetic biology ‚Äî will nature still exist for us to save?

The MIT Media Lab is an interdisciplinary research laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology devoted to projects at the convergence of technology, multimedia, sciences, art and design. Its new identity builds on the previous system, which launched with the Lab's 25th anniversary in 2010 and was designed by Richard The and Roon Kang. The new solution developed by Bierut and Pentagram designer Aron Fay uses the seven-by-seven grid of The's anniversary logo to generate a simple ‚ÄúML‚Äù monogram that serves as the logo for the Media Lab. Using that same grid, the designers extended the identity to each of the 23 research groups that lie at the heart of the Lab's activity.

This campaign for MCA Chicago's exhibition responded to the brief that 'Every piece of art is a story waiting to be uncovered'. The ads aimed to make the exhibition‚Äîwhich explores contemporary artists' interests in history, archaeology and archival research‚Äîaccessible to the general public. Four bus shelter ads placed around Chicago's Loop and a tip-in newspaper advertisement gave users the opportunity to become archaeologists and archive their own histories through the familiar language of lotto scratch-offs. When users scratched off the silver layer, which depicted a shovel artist Mark Dion illustrated for the exhibition catalogue, they revealed local artist Tony Tasset's colorful portrait of himself dressed as Robert Smithson, as well as an offer for two-for-one admission to the museum.

<p>
2.5 billion people around the globe have no access to safe sanitation, causing severe diarrhoea, which kills 1.8 million people each year, primarily children under the age of 5. Furthermore, urine and faeces are severely polluting the environment. Blue Diversion is a grid-free dry diversion toilet, ie with no connection to piped water, sewers or electricity. Urine, faeces and flush-and-wash water are collected separately below the pan. The used water is recovered directly in the toilet by means of an innovative, energy-efficient and maintenance-free membrane bioreactor followed by on-site production of chlorine through electrolysis. This multi-barrier water treatment system included in the back wall of the toilet provides about 7 litres of hygienically safe water per user and day with little energy (provided by a small solar panel on the roof) and only minimal water losses. The Blue Diversion Toilet features a business model, which includes a collection system for urine and faeces, along with semi-centralised recycling plants for the production of valuable fertiliser and biogas.

Current table is a piece of furniture that also harvests energy from daylight to charge appliances. The glass table surface contains a Dye Sensitised Solar Cell. Based on photosynthesis it uses the properties of colour to create an electrical current. Unlike classic solar cells, these coloured cells don't need direct sunlight and are able to function under diffused light.

Double O is an innovative bike light that locks with your bike for convenience and security, and delivers light that is bright but not blinding to other road users. An in-built hard-wearing, flexible strap allows the Double O to be attached to a bike, bag or helmet. Many bike lights end up lost or stolen - with Double O, the circular shape also provides a way of securely locking up the lights by slipping them onto a D-lock.

<p>
The design of this chair was derived from observations made on dragonflies, whose bodies are characterized by an imbalance in weight distribution between the front legs and their extended tail. From this came the idea of a cantilever chair with four legs joined on the front and a seating surface that seems to cheat the force of gravity like an overhang. The back legs are obtained from the same metal pipe that is also framing the front edge of the seat.

Ecovative create high-performing biocomposites from humble raw materials. They use fungal mycelium, the root-like structure of a mushroom, to glue together agricultural wastes into high-performing and sustainable products. The resulting material is also completely compostable, so at the end of its useful life, it can be returned to the soil as a nutrient. Grow It Yourself empowers artists, makers, and innovators to use this potentially revolutionary material for their own projects.

Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have adapted computer microchip manufacturing methods to design and fabricate crystal-clear microdevices lined with living human cells that mimic the complex tissue structures, functions and mechanical motions of whole organs; they are essentially living 'Human Organs-on-Chips'. Each Organ-on-a-Chip models natural tissue structures and mirrors the dynamic mechanical behavior of internal organs. Chips can also can be linked to form a 'Human Body-on-Chips', which can be analyzed to learn how drugs impact each organ as they are distributed and metabolized throughout the body. Cells from individual patients or from genetically-related populations can be used to inhabit these Organs-on-Chips to build mimics of their organs, a tactic that promises to advance personalized medicine, accelerate drug discovery and decrease development costs.

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-2-1-12-3-5-17">
<p>
Project Daniel is the world's first 3D-printing prosthetic lab, set up by Not Impossible founder Mick Ebeling after he saw footage of a teenager who lost both arms when a bomb went off while he was tending his parents' cattle. The young man was Daniel Omar, a resident of a sprawling refugee camp called Yida. Ebeling tracked him down via humanitarian physician Dr. Tom Catena, and set about creating new limbs for Daniel with the help of a team of makers and Richard van As, the founder of open-source 3D-printing prosthetic company Robohand. The project has a legacy beyond Daniel's new limbs ‚Äî Not Impossible left two 3D printers in Dr. Catena's Nuba Mountains hospital, in a community that had no concept of 3D-printing before his arrival. Ebeling trained locals to use the equipment so that other victims of the conflict are able to get access to a limb that costs $100 of materials, a fraction of the price of traditional solutions.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-2-1-15-2">

<p>
Note: This is from Sacha Chua's EMACS chat with Christopher Wellons
around 31:00: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr06UDD4mCs#t=1215">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr06UDD4mCs#t=1215</a>

</p>

<p>
Here is what he writes about notmuch vs mu4e:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
notmuch vs mu4e
</p>

<p>
Since I decided early on to go with an Emacs-based e-mail client, learning a new e-mail client got a lot easier. I know Emacs Lisp pretty darn well. In the worst case of getting stuck, I could very easily study the client's source code and work out for myself whatever is going on. I could even monkey patch it in my configuration if it was causing problems for me (and I've already done exactly that).
</p>

<p>
I wanted to use the Maildir format, something I could hack on if needed. The two obvious choices for this were mu4e and notmuch, both started in 2009. I initially reached for mu4e. Compared to notmuch, it follows Emacs idioms more closely. For example, the e-mail listing is oriented around a mark and execute paradigm, like a dired buffer. After an initial glance, it felt more integrated.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, mu4e is still not mature enough for real productive use, making it far too risky for e-mail. I found out the hard way that the database format has varied regularly between versions. Worse, mu4e is not suitable for remote access. Not only does it assume the Maildir directory is on the local host, it uses absolute paths to access it, so it won't work over sshfs as I had hoped. Bummer.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the notmuch client is specifically designed to be operated remotely. Emacs doesn't realize that it runs the notmuch client over SSH. Emacs doesn't need to touch the Maildir directly. It's a beautiful setup, one very friendly to versioning dotfiles. I've already done some pretty heavy configuration to get it exactly the way I want it. On top of this, notmuch is incredibly fast and stable. It's been a very enjoyable client. So much so that it inspired me to build a web feed reader with a similar interface (to be described in my next post).

<p>
For more information, see: worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum
Throughout the history of science, diagrams and graphs have been essential thinking tools. In the past, such visualizations were drawn with pen on paper, and could embrace the directness, freedom, and expressiveness of hand drawing. Most modern visualizations are programmed instead, where a single description can dynamically generate a unique picture for any dataset.
</p>

<p>
Today's tools offer the benefits of one or the other &#x2013; either directness or dynamics &#x2013; but not both. Photoshop and Illustrator allow direct-manipulation drawing of static pictures. D3, R, and Processing allow indirect-manipulation coding of dynamic pictures.
This talk presents a tool for drawing dynamic pictures &#x2013; creating data-driven visualizations, like D3, but via direct manipulation of the picture itself, like Illustrator.

<p>
The essay that triggered the discussion on toplap here: <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/</a>
</p>

<p>
Quote:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Here's a trick question: <i>How do we get people to understand programming?</i>
</p>

<p>
Khan Academy recently launched an online environment for learning to program. It offers a set of tutorials based on the JavaScript and Processing languages, and features a "live coding" environment, where the program's output updates as the programmer types.
</p>

<p>
Because my work was cited as an inspiration for the Khan system, I felt I should respond with two thoughts about learning:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming is a way of thinking, not a rote skill. Learning about "for" loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw.
</li>
<li>People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, the goals of a programming system should be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>to support and encourage powerful ways of thinking
</li>
<li>to enable programmers to see and understand the execution of their programs
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A live-coding Processing environment addresses neither of these goals. JavaScript and Processing are poorly-designed languages that support weak ways of thinking, and ignore decades of learning about learning. And live coding, as a standalone feature, is worthless.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This question will seem preposterous to most. Viruses
are molecular genetic parasites and are mostly recognized for
their ability to induce disease in their host. Their effect on host
evolution has long been thought to be like that of a predator on its
prey, eliminating the host with weakened defenses. How can we propose
any constructive role for viruses? Many viruses, however, can
infect their host in a stable and persisting manner, generally with no
disease, often for the life of the host. Such viruses can bring to bear
onto their host the viral seeds of genetic creation. (Villareal: 1).

At age 17, Roussel wrote Mon √Çme, a long poem published three years later in Le Gaulois. By 1896, he had commenced editing his long poem La Doublure when he suffered a mental crisis. After the poem was published on June 10, 1897 and was completely unsuccessful, Roussel began to see the psychiatrist Pierre Janet.

Raymond Roussel was born in Paris in 1877. His writings, including the novels Impressions of Africa and Locus Solus and volumes of poetry and drama, were largely ignored in his lifetime, but have since been championed by the likes of Michel Leiris (whose father was Roussel‚Äôs accountant), Raymond Queneau, Alain Robbe-Grillet (his first novel, Le Voyeur, was originally titled La Vue in homage to Roussel‚Äôs long 1904 poem of the same name), Georges Perec, Harry Mathews, John Ashbery and Michel Foucault (Foucault wrote a critical study, Death and the Labyrinth, after the chance discovery of one of Roussel‚Äôs volumes in an antiquarian shop across from the Luxembourg Gardens). Roussel died under mysterious circumstances (apparently by suicide) in 1933 in Palermo, Sicily after he went broke chasing literary fame before his death ‚Äì decades before his work began receiving the acceptance he craved. He is buried in P√®re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

In 1894, at age 16, he inherited a substantial fortune from his deceased father and began to write poetry to accompany his musical compositions. Tremendously wealthy, he took two world tours during which he hardly left his hotel rooms.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.5" name="fn.5" class="footnum" href="#fnr.5">5</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
The story told in Impressions of Africa is a nominally bare-bones fantasy. The shipwrecked inhabitants of the Lyseus, en route from Marseille to Argentina, are captured by an African potentate, Talou, who holds them hostage while awaiting their ransom. The ship‚Äôs manifest includes actors, singers, musicians, fearless naturalists, a slew of carpenters, and, fortuitously, a trove of instruments, lumber, scientific equipment, and trained animals. Partly to keep themselves busy, the motley Europeans, dubbing themselves the Incomparables, decide to stage a set of performances. Converging with their gala is Talou‚Äôs military triumph over a rival clan (and the execution of a handful of unloyal subjects). This is the back-story of Impressions of Africa, literally.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.6" name="fn.6" class="footnum" href="#fnr.6">6</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
New Impressions of Africa is a 1,274-line poem, consisting of four long cantos in rhymed alexandrines, each a single sentence with parenthetical asides that run up to five levels deep. From time to time, a footnote refers to a further poem containing its own depths of brackets. Roussel worked and reworked the 1,274 lines of New Impressions of Africa over a seventeen-year period, rewriting each one as many as twenty times to accomplish a mordant succinctness.

Around the same point in time, Dr. Freud was explaining in his lectures that complex machines that repeat in dreams signified the genital organs. Roussel‚Äôs descriptions of eggs on plates and the multiple allusions to the odor of urine after the eating of asparagus are typical of a poetic-mechanical apparatus helping to take us further into the area of the unconscious and the sexual.
</p></div>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.8" name="fn.8" class="footnum" href="#fnr.8">8</a></sup> <p class="footpara">
Roussel had kept this compositional method a secret until the publication of his posthumous text, How I Wrote Certain of My Books, where he describes it as follows: ‚ÄúI chose two similar words. For example, billard (billiard) and pillard (looter). Then I added to it words similar but taken in two different directions, and I obtained two almost identical sentences thus. The two sentences found, it was a question of writing a tale which can start with the first and finish by the second. Amplifying the process then, I sought new words reporting itself to the word billiards, always to take them in a different direction than that which was presented first of all, and that provided me each time a creation moreover. The process evolved/moved and I was led to take an unspecified sentence, of which I drew from the images by dislocating it, a little as if it had been a question of extracting some from the drawings of rebus.‚Äù
